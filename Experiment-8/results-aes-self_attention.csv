"The aim of this experiment was to discover certain properties of SnI4 prepared through condensing and crystallisation. The pH, halide presence, solubility as compared to other salts, and organic solubility of a solution of the crystal were tested. Tin (1.0 g) and iodine (2.5 g) were measured and then placed in a flask for condensing. Toluene (10 mL) and 2-3 anti-bumping granules were added to the flask. This flask was connected to a clamped reflux condenser and heated using a hotplate at 60% power. Once the vapour becomes a vibrant orange and the condensing solvent becomes colourless, the hotplate was switched off. After condensing was complete, the solution was placed in another flask and 40-60 petroleum spirit (10 mL) was added. This flask was placed in an ice bath for approximately 5 minutes to encourage crystallisation. The residual tin in the previously heated flask was rinsed with acetone and weighed. After crystallisation has been completed, the crystals were dried through Buchner funnel and vacuum filtration, using 40-60 petroleum spirit to wash. Once the precipitate was massed, a solution was created using one micro-spatula tip in water (15-20 mL). The pH of this solution was measured using pH paper. The solution (1-2 mL) was mixed for 30 seconds with 0.1 M silver nitrate (4-5 drops) in a test tube and the resultant visual qualities were recorded. A Beilstein test was performed to test for halides by dipping heated copper wire in the solution and then heated again over a Bunsen burner. The flame colour was recorded. The solution (1-2 mL) was mixed for 30 seconds with 3% hydrogen peroxide in a third test tube, and petrol (2-3 mL) was added. The resultant visual qualities were recorded.",0.7322182655334473,0.6800000071525574
"The experiment aimed to react tin with iodine to create tin (IV) iodide crystals, then test the tin (IV) iodide for its reactivity. To form the tin (IV) iodide, white tin (0.99g) and iodine pellets (2.52g) were heated under reflux in toluene solvent (10ml). Once the solvent had become clear, the reaction mixture was left to cool. Then, the crystals were isolated and dried via vacuum filtration with petroleum 40-60 solvent. To calculate yields, the masses of tin (IV) iodide product and unreacted tin were weighed. Then, a microspatula-tip of the crystals were dissolved in the minimum volume of deionised water to form a solution. For test 1, a sample of the solution (c. 2mL) was mixed with silver (I) nitrate (0.1M, 5 drops), stirred and the change observed. For test 2, a clean copper wire was heated under a Bunsen burner, placed in the solution and then back into the Bunsen burner; the flame colour was then noted.
