"The aim of this experiment was to prepare tin iodide from its elements through recrystallisation, the resulting crystals then went through a number of tests to examine the reactivity. Tin and iodine were weighed. Tin (0.99g) was added to a flask along with of iodine(2.49g). Toluene(10cm3) was also added. The mixture was then set up for reflux. The heating mantle was then removed when the solution had finished refluxing. This was indicated by the solution changing colour from violet to orange and the condensing solvent turned clear. The solution was then decanted into a flask and 40/60 petroleum spirit (10cm3) was added. The flask was the added to an ice bath to allow to cool to recrystalise. The remaining tin and reaction flask was washed with acetone. The tin was then left to dry and weighed obtaining a measurement of 0.52g of dried tin. Orange crystals started to form in the flask. The contents of the flask were then filtered and washed with 40/60 petroleum spirit. The dried crystals were then weighed, and the mass was recorded to be 1.96g. A micro spatula tip of dried crystals was added to water (20cm3) to dissolve. The solution was shaken until there was no more traces of dried crystals.

The solution was decanted into a conical flask (100 cm3). The remaining tin was washed out with acetone and weighed. Petroleum spirit 40/60 (10 cm3) was added to the conical flask and the conical flask was then cooled in an ice bath. After the crystals (SnI4) had evolved, the crystals were filtered via a Buchner funnel. The dry crystals were then weighed. A micro spatula heap of SnI4 crystals were dissolved in water. Test 1: added 4-5 drops of AgNO3 (0.1 M) to 1-2 cm3 of the dissolved SnI4. Test 2: Beilstein test, heated a copper wire, dipped it in the solution and heated it again under Bunsen flame.",0.7634420990943909,0.800000011920929
"First, tin metal (1.0g) was measured and transferred to a round-bottom flask (100ml) using a powder funnel, along with iodine pellets (2.5g), first onto a watchglass and then into the same flask, ensuring no iodine pellets are spilled onto the bench. Toluene (10cm3) was then added to the flask, along with 2-3 anti-bumping granules. It was then heated under reflux using a heating mantle and reflux condenser until the condensing solvent turned transparent. The flask solution was poured into a conical flask (100cm3). The remaining tin metal in the flask, after washing with acetone and drying, weighed 0.37g. Petroleum ether 40/60 (10cm3) was added to the conical flask and left to cool. The crystals in the flask were then extracted by filtration using a Buchner funnel. This yielded 1.36g of crystals. A micro spatula of the crystals were then dissolved in water (15cm3) and stirred until fully dissolved. This solution was used to perform chemical tests 1, 2 and 3. In this experiment, we aimed to form tin iodide (IV) using tin metal and iodine pellets and heating them together, with the solvent toluene, via reflux using a reflux condenser. After forming the suspected tin (IV) iodide complex, we aimed to confirm the presence of the tin (IV) iodide using three confirmatory tests using silver nitrate (0.1M) solution, hydrogen peroxide with petroleum ether 40/60 and the Beilstein test. We aimed to also use these tests to determine the reactivity of our crystalline product.",0.6381319761276245,0.6000000238418579
"This experiment seeks to synthesize and purify tin(IV) iodide from tin metal and iodine, and then conduct three tests on the compound to examine its reactivity. The first test sought to examine tin(IV) iodide�s ability to produce a precipitate with silver nitrate. The second test was a Beilstein test, which was used to test tin(IV) iodide for the presence of an organic halide. The third test sought to examine tin(IV) iodide�s solubility in water and petroleum ether. 1.04 g of tin metal and 2.11 g iodine pellets were dissolved in 10 mL of toluene and heated in a reflux condenser in order to produce tin(IV) iodide. When the solution was allowed to cool, tin(IV) iodide crystals formed in the solution and were extracted using a Buchner funnel.",0.6282795071601868,0.699999988079071

"The aim of the experiment was to prepare an isolated sample of SnI4 and assess its reactivity by performing a series of three tests. Tin metal (1.20 g, 0.010 mol) was added to iodine (2.5 g, 0.0099 mol) and toluene (10 cm3, 0.020 mol). Solution was allowed to reflux at ~ 60% power until the condensing solvent turned from violet to clear. The resulting hot orange solution was decanted off and added to petroleum spirit 40/60 (10 cm3, 0.080 mol). Residual tin (0.54 g, 0.0046 mol) metal was washed with excess acetone and the dry solid weighed. The solution was allowed to cool to room temperature, and then was cooled in an ice-bath for ~ 5 minutes. Orange crystals were then purified with vacuum filtration and washed with cold petroleum spirit 40/60. The purified SnI4 was obtained as an orange crystalline solid (1.82 g, 0.029 mol). A heaped microspatula of SnI4 was dissolved in water (20 cm3). Resulting solution (2 cm3) was transferred to three test tubes. To test tube 1, silver nitrate (5 drops, 0.1 M) was added and gently shaken for 30 seconds and observations logged. Heated copper wire was immersed in test tube 2 and then heated in a Bunsen flame, with the flame colour observed. To test tube 3, hydrogen peroxide (10 drops, 0.88 M) was added and shaken for 30 seconds, then petroleum spirit 40/60 (3 cm3) was added.

Using a clamp to hold the hot flask, decant the solution into a 100cm3 conical flask, leaving the left-over tin in the round bottom flask. Add 10cm3 of petroleum 40/60 to the conical flask then allow to cool to room temperature. Use acetone to wash the residual tin in the reaction flask, then allow the tin to dry on a watchglass � once dry, weigh the tine and record the mass. As the conical flask cools, orange crystals should start to form, the flask can be placed in an ice-bath for roughly five minutes in order to maximise crystallisation. Use a buchner funnel to filter of the crystals, washing them with around 10cm3 of petroleum 40/60, once this process is complete weigh your dried crystals and record the mass. The chemicals properties of the product will now be tested, your observations should be noted throughout. Measure roughly 15-20mL of water and dissolve a heaped micro spatula tip in the water, stir until the solid can not be seen. Using pH paper, check the pH of this solution.

"The aim of the experiment was to synthesize the compound Tin (IV) Iodide from its base components of pure tin metal and iodine pellets. Once the synthesis was complete, the next step was to test the resultant substance on various chemical characteristics. First, 1.00 g of tin and 2.53 g of iodine were added to a flask containing 10 cm3 toluene. The resultant solution was heated using a heating mantle and reflux condenser, until the resultant concentration from the solution�s boiling was became clear. At this point, the solution was cooled, and the resultant orange solution was decanted, with the residual tin massed. 10 cm3 Petroleum spirit 40/60 was then added to the orange solution, and then the solution was cooled in an ice bath until orange crystals were elucidated. These crystals were then filtered using a Buchner funnel and washed with 10 cm3 of cold petroleum spirit 40/60. At this point, the orange crystals were dissolved in water and three tests were performed: Test 1:  A small amount of 0.1 M silver nitrate was added to a portion of the solution and mixed.

"The aim of the experiment was to create a sample of Tin (IV) Iodide using reflux. I added 1g of tin, 2.5g of iodine, 10mL of toluene and 3 anti-bumping granules to a 100mL round bottomed flask. I then heated the solution under reflux until the condensate was colourless. At which point I removed the heat from the round bottomed flask and allowed it to cool until evaporation stops. I then decanted off the solution into a conical flash. I then added 10mL to the conical flask and allowing to cool to room temperature. I washed the residual tin in the round bottomed flask with acetone. And weighed the dry tin. I put the conical flask with the SnI4 in into an ice bath, to aid precipitation. I then vacuum filtered the crystals. I then dissolved a heaped spatula of the crystals in to 20mL of water, and transferred 2mL each to 3 test tubes. I added 2mL of 0.1M silver nitrate to the first test tube, resulting in a cr�me precipitate being formed. I heated up some copper wire red hot, and dipped the hot end in the second test tube. This resulted in a vibrant green coloured flame being emitted. To the third test tube I added 10 drops of 3% hydrogen peroxide, the solution changed colour from colourless to yellow/brown.
