"Name and Group Number Mwawasi Divine Kristy Mkamwasi Group 16 Date Submitted 27/11/2019 Aim This experiment was aimed at preparing a sample of tin iodide (SnI4) from its constituent elements, isolating the product and using chemical tests to investigate its reactivity. Procedure Toluene (10cm3) was added to a mixture of iodine (2.5g) and tin (1.0g). The resultant mixture was heated under reflux until the condensing solvent became clear and the initially purple solution turned orange. The reaction flask was allowed to cool until the solvent stopped condensing. The hot solution was then decanted to separate it from the residual tin metal. Petroleum spirit 40/60 (10cm3) was added to the hot solution before it was allowed to cool to room temperature. The residual tin was washed with acetone, dried and then weighed. When orange crystals began to form in the solution, it was put in an ice bath for 5 minutes to maximise crystallisation. The crystals were filtered out of the solution under suction and then washed using petroleum spirit 40/60 (10cm3). They were then allowed to dry and weighed. The product (heaped microspatula) was dissolved in water (20 mL). The pH of the resulting solution was then tested using pH paper. Three more chemical tests were performed on the resulting solution. In test one, silver nitrate (5 drops, 0.1M) was added to the solution (2mL). Test 2 was the �Beilstein� test where a glowing hot copper rod was immersed into the solution (2mL) and heated to test. In the final test,  Hydrogen peroxide (10 drops, 3%w/v) was added to the solution (2mL). It was then shaken and petrol(3mL)",0.739218533039093,0.8799999952316284
"The experiment aimed to react tin with iodine to create tin (IV) iodide crystals, then test the tin (IV) iodide for its reactivity. To form the tin (IV) iodide, white tin (0.99g) and iodine pellets (2.52g) were heated under reflux in toluene solvent (10ml). Once the solvent had become clear, the reaction mixture was left to cool. Then, the crystals were isolated and dried via vacuum filtration with petroleum 40-60 solvent. To calculate yields, the masses of tin (IV) iodide product and unreacted tin were weighed. Then, a microspatula-tip of the crystals were dissolved in the minimum volume of deionised water to form a solution. For test 1, a sample of the solution (c. 2mL) was mixed with silver (I) nitrate (0.1M, 5 drops), stirred and the change observed.

"The aim of the experiment was form crystallised SnI4 from its constituent elements and perform 3 simple tests to examine it�s reactivity. Solid tin (1.01g) and iodine pellets (2.50g) formed a purple solution with 10cm3 of toluene and was heated under reflux until the solution turned orange and the condensing liquid was colourless. The solution was cooled and transferred into a conical flask to isolate the unreacted tin (0.43g). 10cm3 petroleum 40/60 was added to the orange solution in the conical flask. The conical flask was placed in an ice bath to maximise crystallisation. The solution was filtered under reduced pressure to form a bright orange crystal powder. 2.15g of pure SnI4 crystals was collected. A heaped micro spatula of my orange crystals was dissolved in enough distilled water to dissolve all the crystals (approx. 20cm3) The first chemical test involved adding 4-5 drops of 0.1M silver nitrate to 1.6ml of my solution, and my pale yellow solution turned cloudy. The second test was the �Beilstein test� where a hot copper wire was submerged in 1.32ml of my solution and held over a Bunsen burner. A bright green flame was observed. The third test involved adding 10 drops of 3% hydrogen peroxide and 2.4ml of petroleum 40/60 to 1.36ml of my solution. After the addition of H2O2, the solution turned darker yellow and on standing turned brown.

"The overall aim of the experiment was to prepare a sample of a species of tin iodide and qualitatively measure the reactivity of this species. In order to do this, tin metal (1g) and iodine pellets (2.5g) were condensed along with toluene (10cm3) until the solution changed colour from violet  (orange)  colourless. After heating was complete, the now colourless solution was decanted and petroleum spirit 40/60 was added to it before being cooled to room temperature. The tin metal which remained in the flask was then weighed. Next, the colourless solution was placed in an ice bath to maximise crystallisation (of the orange crystals). The final step in preparing the crystals was that the suspension was recrystalised from petroleum spirit 40-60 (10cm3) and the mass of the orange crystals (Tin Iodide, SnI4) was measured. To prepare a solution for the following tests, a heaped micro-spatula tip of the product, tin iodide was fully dissolved in water (15mL) and the pH of the solution was taken. For test 1, 2mL of the solution prepared in the above step was placed in a test tube with a few drops of 0.1M silver nitrate and shook for 30 seconds.

"The desired outcome of this experiment was to produce tin iodide from its constituent elements and analyse its reactivity. This was done by heating iodine pellets and tin together under reflux with toluene. The solution changed from purple to orange once the iodine fully reacted. The leftover tin was removed and weighed and then 40/60 petroleum was added to the orange solution which was allowed to cool enabling recrystallisation. The orange crystals were extracted using reduced pressure filtration, washed with cold solvent and then weighed.
