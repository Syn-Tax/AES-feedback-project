"Aims: The aims of the experiment were to synthesize and isolate SnI4 from its respective elements, and to investigate the compound�s reactivity and chemical behavior with tests. Procedure: Tin metal (1g) was added to a flask along with iodine pellets (2.5g), toluene (10cm3) and a few anti-bumping granules. This mixture was heated under reflux until the condensing solvent ran clear. The solvent in the flask was allowed to cool to the point where the solvent stopped condensing, and then was decanted. Petroleum spirit 40-60 (10cm3) was then added to the refluxed solvent. The residual tin metal left in the reaction flask was washed with acetone and then weighed. The solution in the flask was allowed to cool fully, and the crystals that formed were then filtered using vacuum filtration � the crystals were washed with cold petroleum spirit 40-60 throughout. Once the crystals were washed and dried, they were weighed. A solution was then made; a combination of the crystals (micro-spatula tip) and water (15mL). A sequence of tests was then carried out on the solution (1-2mL for each test); first being the addition of silver nitrate (0.1M, 4-5 drops). Then, for the second test, a copper wire was heated in a Bunsen flame, dipped into the solution, then placed back into the flame. For the last test, hydrogen peroxide (3%, 10 drops) and petroleum spirit 40-60 (2-3mL) were added to the solution.

Tin metal (1.0 g), iodine pellets (2.5 g), toluene (10 cm3) and 2 or 3 anti-bumping granules were heated under reflux until a violet vapour started condensing. The solution was allowed to cool until the solvent stopped condensing. The residual tin was then washed with acetone and left to dry. Petroleum spirit (10 cm3, 40/60) was added to the hot solution and left to cool to room temperature and then furthered cooled in an ice bath in order to maximise crystallization. The product was vacuum filtered to separate the crystals from the solution and washed with petroleum spirit (10 cm3, 40/60). The final product, SnI4, was collected and observed as orange crystals. A solution was then made from the synthesized SnI4 (heaped spatula) with water (20 mL). When the orange solid had fully dissolved, the pH of the solution was tested using universal pH paper.
