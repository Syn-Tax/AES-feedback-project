"Aim- to prepare tin iodide and examine the reactivity by carrying out 3 different tests. Procedure- tin metal(1g) was transferred to a Quickfit round bottom flask and iodine(2.55g) was added. Toluene(10cm3) and anti-bumping granules were added as well. The flask was attached to a reflux condenser and then heated until the condensing solvent was clear. The solution was transferred to a conical flask, petroleum spirit 40-60 was added and then cooled in an ice bath for 5 minutes. The residual tin was left in the reaction flask, washed out with acetone, dried and then weighed (0.42g). The crystals in the conical flask were filtered off and washed with petroleum spirit 40-60 then weighed(1.9g). Tests- a spatula of the crystals was dissolved in water(20ml) Test 1- the solution (2ml) was transferred to a test tube and 0.1mL silver nitrate was added (5 drops) and shaken for 30 seconds. Test 2- in a fume cupboard the solution(2mL) was transferred to a test tube and the end of a hot copper wire was put in the solution, the wire was heated again by a Bunsen.",0.7106205821037292,0.8500000238418579
"The aim of this experiment was to create SnI4 from the reaction between elemental tin and iodine and then to assess its properties by carrying out three tests. 1.0g of tin was added to a 100ml round bottom along with approximately 2.5g of iodine weighed accurately on a watch glass, which should then be added to the flask with a powder funnel. 10cm3 of toluene should be added to the flask along with some anti-bumping granules. The round bottom flask should then be heated under reflux with a heating mantle until the purple vapor turns clear and the solution has turned purple. The flask should then be removed from heat once the solvent stopped condensing the solution should be decanted into a 100ml flask, leaving unreacted tin which should be washed in acetone then dried on a watch glass and weighed. 10cm3 of petroleum spirit 40/60 should be added to the reaction flask and then left to cool to room temperature. Orange crystals should begin to form which once fully recrystallized should be separated from the solution using a Buchner funnel. A heaped microspatula of the crystal should be dissolved in 15ml of water and the pH should be checked. For the first test 2ml of the solution should be added to a test tube and 5 drops of 0.1m of silver nitrate should be added and the result observed and recorded For the second test 2ml of the solution should be added to a test tube and in a fume hood, a copper wire should be heated in a Bunsen until its red hot, placed in the test tube then placed back in the flame. The resulting colour in the flame should be recorded. For the third test 2ml of the solution should be added to another test tube along with 10 drops of 3% hydrogen peroxide and 2ml of petroleum ether and shaken for 30 seconds.

"The aim of this experiment was to facilitate a reaction between tin metal and iodine to produce and recrystallize tin (IV) iodide. In addition to this, three tests were performed to determine the reactions between various chemicals and a solution created from the addition of water to a sample of the recrystallized SnI4. 1.31g of tin metal, 2.52g of iodine, and 10ml of toluene were added to a 100ml Quickfit round bottom flask. This mixture was heated using a hot plate and a reflux condenser. The mixture was heated until the mixture changed from its original deep violet colour to orange, and its vapour turned clear. Once the reaction was completed the mixture was transferred to a conical beaker and 10ml of petroleum spirit 40/60 was added. The beaker was then placed on ice to allow for recrystallization of the SnI4. Once the crystals had formed and the solution was cool the crystals were filtered out using a Buchner funnel facilitated by petroleum spirit 40/60. From this point the tests were conducted using a solution of a micro spatula tip of SnI4 added to 20ml water that were thoroughly mixed. The first test consisted of 1-2ml of this solution being transferred to a test tube and then adding 4-5 drops of 0.1M silver nitrate, which was then shaken gently. The second test was conducted by placing a copper wire in the flame of a Bunsen Burner and noting the flame�s colour. Then the same copper wire was dipped into the SnI4 and water solution and placed back in the flame. The colour was once again noted. Finally, another 1-2ml of the solution were placed in a test tube and 10 drops of 3% hydrogen peroxide were added and the colour noted, then 2-3 ml of petroleum spirit 40/60 was added to the same test tube and the colour and biphasic separation was noted.
