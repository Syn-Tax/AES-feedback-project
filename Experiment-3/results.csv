"Name and Group Number Mwawasi Divine Kristy Mkamwasi Group 16 Date Submitted 27/11/2019 Aim This experiment was aimed at preparing a sample of tin iodide (SnI4) from its constituent elements, isolating the product and using chemical tests to investigate its reactivity. Procedure Toluene (10cm3) was added to a mixture of iodine (2.5g) and tin (1.0g). The resultant mixture was heated under reflux until the condensing solvent became clear and the initially purple solution turned orange. The reaction flask was allowed to cool until the solvent stopped condensing. The hot solution was then decanted to separate it from the residual tin metal. Petroleum spirit 40/60 (10cm3) was added to the hot solution before it was allowed to cool to room temperature. The residual tin was washed with acetone, dried and then weighed. When orange crystals began to form in the solution, it was put in an ice bath for 5 minutes to maximise crystallisation. The crystals were filtered out of the solution under suction and then washed using petroleum spirit 40/60 (10cm3). They were then allowed to dry and weighed. The product (heaped microspatula) was dissolved in water (20 mL). The pH of the resulting solution was then tested using pH paper. Three more chemical tests were performed on the resulting solution. In test one, silver nitrate (5 drops, 0.1M) was added to the solution (2mL). Test 2 was the �Beilstein� test where a glowing hot copper rod was immersed into the solution (2mL) and heated to test. In the final test,  Hydrogen peroxide (10 drops, 3%w/v) was added to the solution (2mL). It was then shaken and petrol(3mL)",0.6740211844444275,0.8799999952316284
"Aims: The aims of the experiment were to synthesize and isolate SnI4 from its respective elements, and to investigate the compound�s reactivity and chemical behavior with tests. Procedure: Tin metal (1g) was added to a flask along with iodine pellets (2.5g), toluene (10cm3) and a few anti-bumping granules. This mixture was heated under reflux until the condensing solvent ran clear. The solvent in the flask was allowed to cool to the point where the solvent stopped condensing, and then was decanted. Petroleum spirit 40-60 (10cm3) was then added to the refluxed solvent. The residual tin metal left in the reaction flask was washed with acetone and then weighed. The solution in the flask was allowed to cool fully, and the crystals that formed were then filtered using vacuum filtration � the crystals were washed with cold petroleum spirit 40-60 throughout. Once the crystals were washed and dried, they were weighed. A solution was then made; a combination of the crystals (micro-spatula tip) and water (15mL). A sequence of tests was then carried out on the solution (1-2mL for each test); first being the addition of silver nitrate (0.1M, 4-5 drops). Then, for the second test, a copper wire was heated in a Bunsen flame, dipped into the solution, then placed back into the flame. For the last test, hydrogen peroxide (3%, 10 drops) and petroleum spirit 40-60 (2-3mL) were added to the solution.

"The aim of the experiment is to make a tin iodide species, Sn(IV) iodide, and study its reactivity through different tests. In addition, the tests performed can confirm whether Sn(IV)iodide has been produced.",0.6706875562667847,0.8299999833106995
"The aim of the experiment was to produce tin iodide (SnI4) from its elements, tin metal and elemental iodine. To do this, 1g of tin metal and 2.5g of iodine were weighed with a balance and transferred into a 100ml Quickfit round-bottom flask. Using a measuring cylinder and a spatula, 10cm3 of Toluene and 3 anti-bumping granules were added to the flask which was assembled with reflux apparatus and a heating mantle. The flask was then heated at 60% power until the violet vapour that evaporated and condensed became clear. The apparatus was then allowed to cool until no more vapour condensed and the hot solution was decanted into a 100ml conical flask carefully. After 10cm3 of petroleum spirit 40/60 was added and the flask was allowed to cool to room temperature, the residual tin was washed with acetone and left to dry so that it could be weighed. Orange crystals of tin iodide began to form as the flask cooled and the flask was put in an ice bath to maximise recrystallisation before the crystals were filtered under suction with a Buchner funnel and washed with 10cm3 petroleum spirit 40/60. A sample vial was weighed and then the crystals were added and it was reweighed to calculate the mass of the dried tin iodide crystals. To perform the chemical tests, one micro spatula tip of the tin iodide crystals from the sample vial was dissolved in 15ml of water. The first test was the pH of the dissolved crystals so a glass rod was dipped into the solution and spotted onto pH paper which revealed that it was pH 1. Another test performed was by adding 5 drops of silver nitrate to 1ml of this solution in a test tube which was shaked for 30 seconds. The Beilstein flame test was done by dipping a hot copper wire into a test tube with 1ml of the tin iodide dissolved in water and putting it into a flame again. Finally, to a test tube with 1ml of the solution, 10 drops of 3% hydrogen peroxide were added and it was shaken for 30 seconds. Then a few drops of petrol were added and the solution was swirled, forming a biphasic solution in the test tube. The aim of the experiment was to produce tin iodide (SnI4) from its elements, tin metal and elemental iodine.

"The aim of this procedure was to synthesise tin iodide from tin metal and iodine via reflux and vacuum filtration and then test its reactivity to certain conditions. 1.0g of tin metal and 2.5g of iodine added to a Quickfit round round-bottom flask. 10cm3 of toluene was then added with 3 anti-bumping granules to the flask and connected up to a reflux condenser where the solution was heated under reflux. The solution was boiled until the solution had turned from violet to orange and the condensing solvent became clear. The contents were then allowed to cool until no more solvent was condensing and then the solution (still hot) was poured into a conical flask, using a clamp, leaving the remaining tin the reaction flask. 10cm3 of petroleum spirit 40/60 was then added to the conical flask and left to cool whilst the remaining tin was washed with acetone, left to dry and then weighed. Orange crystals of SnI4 had formed at the bottom of the conical flask and so were removed from the solution via vacuum filtration using 10cm3 of cold petroleum to wash the crystals. Once dried the mass of the crystals was taken. A heaped micro spatula of SnI4 crystals was then dissolved in 20cm 3 of water and the pH of the solution taken. Using this solution three tests were performed. Three test tubes were filled with 2cm3 of the dissolved SnI4. The first test involved adding 5 drops of 0.1M Silver Nitrate to one of the test tubes and noting observations. The second test involved immersing a red-hot wire into another test tube, then placing it back into a Bunsen flame and noting the flame colour. The third test involved adding 10 drops of 3% hydrogen peroxide to the third test tube, shaking it, adding 3mL of petrol and then swirling the solution noting what was observed.",0.6737654805183411,0.8299999833106995
