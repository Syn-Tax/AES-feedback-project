"Compounds containing N-methylated and ethylated amines are effective in crossing the blood-brain barrier in the human body, making methods of adding this functionality useful in the development of drugs which target the brain and CNS. However, conventional synthesis methods have typically employed the use of toxic reagents such as formaldehyde or expensive rare earth metal-based catalysts containing phosphine ligands, making safer and more sustainable methods sought after. The paper reports on a method for the addition of methyl and ethyl groups to amines under mildly basic conditions, utilizing a catalyst made from earth-abundant iron. The mechanism for the reaction occurs through a ‚Äòhydrogen auto-transfer‚Äô process, wherein the catalyst deprotonates the alcohol, which undergoes a condensation reaction with the target amine, producing an imine. The catalyst transfers the hydrogen to the formed imine, minimizing side-product formation caused by self-condensation, producing methylated and ethylated amines in high yields.",0.5773376822471619,0.8461538553237915
"Mechanisms involving either the release or cleavage of hydrogen in basic conditions involving iron, cyclopentadienone and amines are described. Reasoning for these new techniques in N-ethylation and N-methylation of amines is to resolve the issues of previous methods, which give low yields and are toxic. The primary goal of the work undertaken focuses on the iron catalyst, key for the reaction to proceed, and ultimately optimizing the Fe1 (2 mol %). Having an abundant and inexpensive catalyst is one major selling point of the new experimental method, making it advantageous over previous methods. Going in hand with this, the researchers ran a lot of substrates in course of their report tweaking to find what produces greatest yields and is environmentally friendly (Fe1 (2 mol %)). Researchers also find ethanol is easier to use in the reaction in comparison to methanol.",0.5571854710578918,0.38461539149284363
"Selective semihydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes is considered a highly important reaction in chemical synthesis. Selective semihydrogenation of alkynes to (Z)-alkenes has been investigated multiple times however, selective semihydrogenation of alkynes to (E)-alkenes is an underdeveloped process. Use of 3d transition metals has led to breakthroughs in this process as they require milder conditions. In this article the use of bis(phosphino)silyl Ni hybride complex ((PSiP)-Ni) in catalyzing the reactions of diaryl and SiMe3-protected terminal alkynes to (E)-alkenes is reported. (PSiP)-Ni was found to efficiently catalyze (E)-selective semihydrogenation of alkynes under very mild conditions with H2. Stoichiometric experiments showed the high selectivity of (PSiP)-Ni is due to the alkyne inserting into the complex and isomerization of the alkene being facile processes. This allowed a simple catalytic cycle to be proposed based off the results of the stoichiometric experiments and the reduced ability of (PSiP)-Ni to hydrogenate internal alkenes.",0.5582945346832275,0.692307710647583
"Cu-catalyzed decarboxylative iodination under aerobic condition provides a non-toxic synthesis of aryl iodides, with relative reagent abundance in the form of (hetero)aryl carboxylic acids and NaI, with moderate to good yields of reaction. This is a potential synthetic improvement over established mechanisms to introduce an iodo functional group to an existing aromatic ring, notably electrophilic iodination of activated aromatic compounds (SEAr) with electrophilic iodinating reagents, or direct replacement of diazo group with iodide anion via Sandmeyer reaction. This paper demonstrates the synthetic practicability of aerobic Cu-catalyzed decarboxylative iodination with the 3-step synthesis of thiabendazole, and suggests broader industry usage for applicable scenarios.",0.49887433648109436,0.4615384638309479
"4-trifluoromethyl tetrahydrothiophenes containing heteroatomic functional groups sulfone, sulfoximine, sulfonamide of phosphonate moiety. The products were synthesized using 1,3-dipolar 3+2]-cycloaddition of ùõº,ùõΩ-unsaturated keto compounds and electron deficient trans-alkenes to thiocarbonyl yields. These thiocarbonyl yields were synthesized by elimination reactions in situ from chloromethyl trimethylsilylmethyl sulfide. The crude products were purified by chromatography on silica gel.

"This report discusses the use of the Fe(PMe3)4 catalyst to allow highly selective ortho position addition of alkenes onto aromatic rings with a ketone as part of the aromatic system and the extensive allowed aromatic ketones and alkenes reactants used to form the desired products with a 90% yield or above. The reaction can occur at relatively low temperatures, and a wide variety of solvents may be used in this process to achieve high yields for differing reactions. The 1H NMR spectrum with deuterium was used to determine the nature of the reaction and confirm the anti-Markowhicth addition alkylation reaction nature. This basic reaction is the first of its kind to allow a sustainable ortho anti-Markovnikov addition of an enol ether onto an aromatic system.",0.4730989336967468,0.5384615659713745
"A novel synthetic route for producing phosphorylated pyrrolines has been discovered using silver nitrate and potassium carbonate in methyl cyanide, allowing for radical cyclisation of Œ≥, Œ¥ - unsaturated oximes. Many different conditions were tested, and this route provided the best yield - even when scaled up to 5.0 mmol scale. A variety of reagents were used in conjunction with this new method and their yields show which factors are advantageous in this reaction. A potential mechanism has also been presented and has potential in accessing bulky phosphine ligands with coordinated pyrroline units via deoxidation pathways in a much more direct way than previously known.",0.46070829033851624,0.4615384638309479
"C-F bonds are considered the most polarized single carbon bonds in organic chemistry due to their electrostatic character. This property is used in both pharmaceutical and agrochemical science to for example tweak polarity. If the C-F bond‚Äôs orientations are further controlled to be on the same face they can be used to design high polar complexes, such as all-cis-multifluorinated cycloalkanes, that can be applied to other scientific areas like material sciences. However, all-cis-multifluorinated cycloalkanes are complex to synthesize as they need multistep sequences from diastereoselectively prefunctionalized precursors. This study therefore postulated a one-step rhodium-cyclic (alkyl) (amino) carbene (CAAC) ‚Äì catalysed hydrogenation pathway to be applied to fluorinated arenes in hexanes, to derive desired cis-fluorinated compounds. The one-step process allows the production of multiple multifluorinated and multisubstituted cycloalkanes such as cis-configured fluorinated aliphatic heterocycles and all-cis-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexafluorocyclohexane.",0.5100865960121155,0.5384615659713745

"Historically, hydrogenation of alkynes to (Z)-alkenes has long been a viable industrial process, while the creation of (E)-alkenes provided more of a challenge. Here we report a method for the (E)-selective semihydrogenation of alkynes using H2 and an (iPr-PSiPInd)NiH complex. This complex displays high E selectivity over a wide range of compounds as well as the ability to act at extremely mild conditions as shown through data recorded from reactions outlined below and their recorded NMR spectra.

"Sulfur compounds containing a tetrahydrothiophene ring system as a core structure have therapeutic applications, hence the demand for new tetrahydrothiophene derivatives is constantly growing at the biological, pharmacological, and medicinal chemistry level. The presence of a trifluoromethyl group is an example of this since it can cause changes in the physico-chemical properties of a molecule. However, not much could be found in the literature. For that reason, the aim of this study was to synthesize trifluoromethyl tetrahydrothiophene derivatives substituted with heteroatomic functional group. The approach for the synthesis consisted of using a [3+2]-cycloaddition reaction of a 1-functionalized 3,3,3-trifluoropropene derivative as dipolarophile with various 1,3 dipoles and thiocarbonyl ylide generated in situ from elimination of chloromethyl trimethylsilylmethyl sulfide. The findings of this study show the formation of a new 4-(trifluoromethyl)tetrahydrothiophenes with ester, sulfone, sulfoximine, sulfonamide, and phospohonate moiety. This was supported via the use of NMR, mass-spectrometry, melting points, and chromatography.",0.6729768514633179,0.7692307829856873
"In this study, the capabilities of ammonium tagged Hoveyda-Grubbs catalyst supported on magnetically separable core/shell silica gels was tested on carboxylic acid additions to terminal alkynes. Variables of substrate/catalyst ratio, temperature, solvent, reaction atmosphere and the carboxylic acid used were investigated for conversion rate and selectivity. The catalytic system was found to be compatible under air atmosphere with non-degassed toluene. The reaction of arylacetylenes with acetic acid showed high E-isomer selectivity (55-69%) with conversion rates of 99% at 85¬∞C with a catalytic loading of 1% Ru. The ratio of acid/alkyne at 10/1 completely suppressed dimerization. The reusability of the catalyst was also tested using acetic acid or benzoic acid with phenylacetylene under pre-determined conditions. The reaction was catalyzed up to the 11th run without any significant activity loss, with a minimum conversion rate of 82% (acetic acid) and 89% (benzoic acid), showing high reusability.",0.6707713603973389,0.5384615659713745
"Chlorotrifluoromethylation of alkenes is often achieved via the photocatalytic reduction of CF3SO2Cl, which requires the use of expensive transition metal complexes as the photocatalyst . This study found that simple divalent copper containing compounds (CuCl2, Cu(OAc)2, Cu(OTf)2 and CuCl) in combination with a base (pyridine, triethylamine and DMAP) were able to efficiently catalyse the same reaction when introduced to an appropriate solvent in high concentrations and low loadings.

"The current process for N-methylation of amines has important in industry and academia, however, the current processes include the use of dangerous compounds or expensive and rare earth metal as catalysts. A new sustainable and safe iron-based catalyst was used in the N-ethylation and N-methylation of amines with ethanol and methanol under basic conditions. N-ethylation of twelve different anilines with ethanol, caesium hydroxide and the Iron catalyst resulted in high yields, while N-methylation of primary and secondary amines with methanol under ten Atmospheres of Hydrogen gas resulted in high yields as well. DFT analysis also shows that Hydrogen displays some importance in the thermodynamic equilibrium of methylation and ethylation of amines as well as being a reducing agent.",0.5887351632118225,0.5384615659713745
"The formation of substituted isochromans through the Oxa-Pictet-Spengler cyclisation is effectively catalysed using Fe(OTf)(2). This was determined experimentally through synthesis of a group of isochromans using various different catalysts being compared to isochromans synthesized using Fe(OTf)(2) catalyst, which were also further tested under varying experimental conditions involving temperature and atmosphere.  Through use of Fe(OTf)(2) up to 99% yield is achieved for the reaction of 1% (mol) Fe(OTf)(2) at 70 ¬∞C. Moreover in a nitrogen atmosphere, the time efficiency of the reaction is concluded experimentally as under 4 hours. In addition, the use of this iron catalyst generates high atom economy and cost effectiveness. Effective synthesis of isochromans has potential benefits in pharmaceutical chemistry and with the only by product to the reaction being the formation of water, the iron catalyst mitigates environmental harm.",0.5204544067382812,0.38461539149284363
"The Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) produce the necessary components of probiotic products based on the rice that can replace the dairy products. Nevertheless, this is the first research that distinguishes two types of fermentation compounds categorized as non-volatile and volatile. In research, we used 12 different types of LABs.   The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and solid-phase microextraction used in the analysis of volatile compounds and gas chromatography-time-of-flight/mass spectrometry (GC-TOF/MS) were analyzed tools for non-volatile compounds. During the analysis step, the principal component analysis (PCA) was used to compare Volatile and non-volatile substances. As results, 45 volatile compounds and 37 non-volatile compounds were distinguished in samples of LABs.  Obligatory homofermentative/ facultatively heterofermentative LAB and obligatory heterofermentative LAB strains have distinguished characteristics of compounds of products. The revealed dependence of the production of particular compounds of substances on the LAB strain can improve probiotic products based on the grains culture.",0.6466495394706726,0.5384615659713745
"R2PNa, R2PLi and R2PK were prepared, applied and studied. Via the reaction of sodium finely dispersed in mineral oil and phosphinites (R2POR‚Äô) or chlorophosphines (R2PCl), or via the reaction of triarylphosphines and diarylphosphines through the cleavage of C-P bonds. Soidum reacted more easily than lithium or potassium in these reactions. R2PAr was efficiently produced when R2PNa was reacted with ArCl compounds. ArBr and ArI gave lower yields and Ph2PLi and Ph2PK did not produce a coupling product with PhCl and gave a low yield of the product respectively. Electron withdrawing groups increased reactivity and alkyl groups decreased reactivity with R2PNa along with vinyl chloride and alkyl chlorides.
