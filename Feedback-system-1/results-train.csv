"The use of Fe(OTf)2 as a catalyst for the synthesis of 1-substituted isochromans via the Oxa-Pictet-Spengler cyclization reaction has proven to be highly effective. The iron-catalyzed reaction between β-arylethanol and a carbonyl compound via intramolecular electrophilic aromatic substitution has shown a significant increase in the yield of the isolated isochroman product. This is advantageous as the catalyst is cost-effective, sustainable and ecological, as only 1 mol% is needed, reaction conditions are mild and the only byproduct of the reaction is water.

"Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) can be used to ferment and improve the organoleptic quality of rice-based drinks as a dairy replacement, yet no study compares the formation of volatile and nonvolatile compounds resulting from this fermentation using various LABs. Here, the formation of said compounds in rice fermented with 12 different LABs following treatment with enzymes was investigated by analyzing gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and gas chromatography-time-of-flight/mass spectrometry (GC-TOF/MS). The results showed formation of volatile acids, aldehydes, esters, ketones, alcohols, furan derivatives, benzene derivatives, hydrocarbons, and terpenes, and formation of nonvolatile amino acids, organic acids, and carbohydrates in varying quantities depending on LAB strain.

"Tetrahydrothiophene ring containing compounds are used in medicinal and chemical fields due to their therapeutical properties. Hence it is of interest to synthesize optimized derivatives. Due to the lack of scientific literature and general experimental data concerning the synthesis of heterocyclic derivatives containing trifluoromethyl group in combination with sulfur or phosphorous, this paper explores the process and optimization of trifluoromethyl tetrahydrothiophene derivative synthesis containing the aforementioned functional groups. A convenient way to synthesise stable derivatives, which were characterised by 1H, 13C, 19F NMR spectra, mass spectroscopy and elementary analysis data, is an elimination – addition pathway using chloromethyl trimethylsilyl methyl sulphide as the starting material, proceeding with a cycloaddition of electron-deficient alkenes to thiocarbonyl yield in situ  and under reflux conditions with excess sulphide and CsF.

This procedure tolerates the use of varying electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups on N-protected indoles and iodoarenes. However, electron-withdrawing groups present on N-protected indoles tend to react slower than the unprotected indoles and relatively do not yield as much. This protocol also exhibits the use of deactivated indole rings without any significant issues and tolerance to the presence of other halogen atoms.

Previously, this has been accomplished in aldehydes with the α-fluoro aldehyde product obtained by enamine catalysis, however, this has not been translated to ketones due to slow condensation with secondary amine catalysts and little control for enamine organization. To address these issues with enamine activation, analysis of a range of amine catalysts was carried out resulting in a Cinchona-based alkaloid catalyst.

This paper outlines a novel approach to the synthesis of nitrated anilides via a regioselective silver-catalysed pathway. Ortho-selective C-H functionalization was achieved using sodium nitrate as a nitrating agent in the presence of K2S2O8 which achieved good yields with both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituents. The proposed mechanism starts with the initial formation of an arylsilver complex and proceeds through radical intermediates to produce the ortho-nitrated products. The nitration of aromatic sulphonamides via this mechanism was also successfully demonstrated. Ortho-nitrated anilides are difficult to access through traditional approaches and this procedure provides an efficient way to synthesis this critical organic precursor for the pharmaceutical and dye industry.,0.462517112493515,0.692307710647583

"A direct method has been reported for the first time for the stereoselective synthesis of multi-substituted cyclobutanes. Unlike previously used synthesis methods such as [2+2] cycloaddition, radical cyclisation, and ring contraction extrusion, this allows for the novel product of cyclobutanes with heterocyclic substituents. A possible mechanism has been proposed for this synthesis involving an initial reaction between the pyrrolidine and iodonitrene species to form a 1,1-diazene. Subsequent elimination of N2, mediated by nitrogen extrusion to generate a 1,4-biradical product which undergoes rapid cyclisation yielding the cyclobutene product is suggested. The viability of this method is proven through the formal synthesis of piperabronine B outlined in this paper. Beyond this, optimum temperature conditions are explored in optimizing the solubility of the starting material and intermediates. Despite these optimized conditions, yield varies from low to good, ranging from 24-42% for pyrrolidines with ⍺-heteroarene substituents, and 42-88% for pyrrolidines with ⍺-aryl substituents.    149 words",0.7115736603736877,0.5384615659713745

"A range of superior reactants and preparation procedures have been studied in association with the synthesis of high yield organophosphines from metal phosphides and aryl halides. Mechanistic pathways have been given following the reductive cleavage of R3P with sodium to produce R2PNa, which further underwent substitution with ArCl to generate R2PAr product. No catalyst was required. Sodium phosphide R2PNa can be prepared with reliable selectivity via C-P bond cleavage of di and triarylphosphines, as well as from reactions with phosphinites and chlorophosphines. R2PNa synthesis was most successful on comparison with other alkali metal substitutes, Li and K. ArCl reacted most efficiently with Ph2PNa when compared to other aryl halides, PhI and PhBr, in which low yields were retrieved. Aryl groups with electron-withdrawing groups accelerated the organophosphine synthesis reaction. Efficient reactions were observed with vinyl, alkyl, admantyl and menthyl chlorides, whilst sterically hindered t-butyl chlorides did not generate the desired product.",0.7830295562744141,0.7692307829856873
"Several methods for the synthesis of 4-tert-butyl-2,6-dinitrobenzaldehyde have been reported for their use as precursor-molecules in the preparation of dyes, pigments, and macrocycles. We report that one method yields not the 2,6-isomer but the 3,5-isomer, 4-tert-butyl-3,5-dinitrobenzaldehyde, as confirmed by comparison with an improved, intentional synthesis of the 3,5-isomer. Another reported method of synthesizing the 2,6-isomer, though viable to produce the claimed product, is not suitable for scaling to a large scale due to its low yield and need for chromium reagents and chromatography. Here, we present an improved, scalable method for the synthesis of 4-tert-butyl-2,6-dinitrobenzaldehyde without the need for either chromatography or chromium reagents.

"Despite the importance of stereodefined organofluorine compounds, to date, enantioselective α-fluorination had only been achieved for aldehyde compounds using enamine catalysis. To find an organocatalyst for the enantioselective alpha-fluorination of ketones, a library of both novel and known amine catalysts was analysed. To find the best system, a mathematical formula combining reaction efficiency and enantiocontrol in a high-throughput analysis was used. It was determined that a cinchona-based amine alkaloid was the optimal catalyst for the highly enantioselective alpha-fluorination of complex carbonyl systems, including five- and seven-membered cyclic ketones. Additionally, the amine catalysed reaction showed high levels of regio-, chemo-, enantio-, and diastereoselectivity for a number of ketones and thus provides a valuable mechanism for the creation of fluorine synthons used in chemical synthesis. 2",0.7683046460151672,0.692307710647583

"Common biological molecules such as DNA and RNA have the ability to self-replicate through kinetically controlled autocatalysis and in the case of some other molecules, cross-catalytic processes. This is due to the presence of precursor, “building block”, molecules that simultaneously catalyse and participate in the target bio-molecule’s formation. These “building blocks” can go many routes to form different molecules and so the products made are present in a mixture of non-specific equilibria. Although some products will be more present than others due to varying bond stability, there has to be some form of selectivity that can favour the desired reaction from a vast library of precursor reagents.

We used preliminary mechanistic experiments to investigate the observed increase in selectivity for the hydrogenated product versus the hydrofluorinated side product by changing the polarity of the solvent; for example, the selectivity using a polar solvent such as methanol (1:9) was compared to that of the less polar solvent dichloromethane (5:1).

This paper presents one such method and conclusively proves that superior results can be obtained through the use of Cinchona alkaloid catalysts in producing α-ﬂuoroketones, incredibly useful medical agents due to their C-F stereocenters. The usage of this primary amine organocatalyst with electrophilic ﬂuorine reagents enabled impressive regio-, chemo-, enantio- and diastereoselectivity for a range of carboxylic and heterocyclic ketone substrates.

However, this reaction uses a relatively simple low-valence iron complex catalyst that is not formed in-situ like most iron catalysed C-H functionalizations. It can be used with or without a solvent at relatively low reaction temperatures, and the linear alkylation products produced have excellent yields.

Organophosphines (R3P) have a variety of applications in organic synthesis and can be generated via the preparation of R2PNa. R2PNa is selectively prepared by reacting SD (sodium dispersed finely in mineral oil) with phosphinites R2POR’ and chlorophosphines R2PCl as well as with the selective cleavage of C-P bonds in diarylphosphines and triarylphosphines. R2PNa then reacts with ArCl to afford R2PAr.  R2PNa produces higher yields and no coupled products unlike the use of R2PLi and R2PK; it is also more economic due to its abundance and safer to handle. ArCl is used in favour of ArBr and ArI due to generating higher yields. The reaction of ArCl and R2PNa was accelerated by the presence of an electron-withdrawing group on the benzene ring and decelerated by alkyl groups.

This method allows for a wide variety of all-cis-(multi)fluorinated cycloalkanes and heterocycles to be directly synthesised due to the hydrogenation tolerance of many functionalities and are anticipated to be useful building blocks in biologically important compounds, pharmaceuticals and materials.",0.5257376432418823,0.6153846383094788
"Self-replication is a crucial part of Darwinian evolution. However, it is unclear where it originated as it does not follow a thermodynamic path towards equilibrium. To investigate its possible emergence, a dynamic combinatorial library was set up using dithiol and alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic α-amino acid building blocks, leucine, and lysine respectively. The mixture was observed under pH 8 and agitation, both stirring and shaking. It was shown through characterization that there was significant formation of macro ß-sheet structures, with agitation increasing their amount. From this a schematic model of self-organisation was proposed with two main processes: elongation of fibres; and breakage of them, which exponentially increased the amount. Differences in formation of heptamer versus hexamer show formation being kinetically determined in the fibre growing phase. These findings support the notion that kinetic products can result from reversible processes if non-covalent interactions are dominant enough.",0.5818541049957275,0.38461539149284363
"Using the reaction between N-phenylacetamide and sodium nitrate (1.0 equiv.) as a base reaction, this extract develops an efficient way of synthesising ortho-nitro anilides from common starting materials. Initial conditions are heavily examined to achieve the highest yield of product throughout. Results showed the most favourable catalyst for the reaction being AgNO2 (79% yield) coupled with CH3CN as the organic solvent and K2S2O8 as the oxidising agent at 110oC. Once established, the reaction was then scrutinised for several other anilides with a variety of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups attached. Furthermore, all ortho C-H bond nitrations showed a good yield however the best yields in general were found with starting products containing electron-donating groups such as an alkyl chain connected to the aromatic ring of the anilide. Based on the observations of the above reactions, a mechanism for ortho C-H bond nitration was proposed using AgNO2 catalyst and conclusion given.",0.6593379974365234,0.6153846383094788

"The organoleptic quality of the rice grains can be increased through the alteration of its tastes and aroma achieved by the fermentation of it using lactic acid bacteria (LAB). Previous studies have reported that this fermentation process can produce volatile and nonvolatile compounds. In this study, the volatile compounds are analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and solid-phase microextraction, and the nonvolatile compounds are determined using gas chromatography-time-of-flight/mass spectrometry after derivatization. 47 volatile compounds were identified, including acids, aldehydes, esters, furan derivatives, ketones, alcohols, benzene and benzene derivatives, hydrocarbons, and terpenes. Also 37 nonvolatile compounds were identified to be amino acids, organic acids, and carbohydrates.

"The presence of a tetrahydrothiophene ring system, in heterocyclic molecules containing sulphur, influences the biological and physio-chemistry of the molecule which can be exploited for medicinal applications.  Publication regarding the properties and derivation of trifluoromethyl tetrahydrothiophene compounds substituted with heteroatomic functional groups are limited in number and the synthesis routes described are often inaccessible.  Thus this paper describes the synthesis of 3-functional 4-trifluoromethyl-tetrahydrothiophenes, which is initiated by producing thiocarbonyl ylide from the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of electron-deficient alkenes; this occurs in situ by elimination of chloromethyl trimethylsilylmethyl sulphide (which is prepared from trimethylsilylmethanethiol, 1,3,5-trioxane and gaseous hydrochloric acid ) and the reaction proceeds under reflux in the presence of acetonitrile,  1.5-fold excess sulphide and 2-fold excess caesium fluoride.  The approach has good yields of 3-functional 4-trifluoromethyl-tetrahydrothiophenes which are composed of only the trans stereoisomer.

"α-Aminophosphonates can be synthesized through two main synthetic routes, the Kabachnik-Fields condensation and the Pudovik reaction, and are significant to medicinal and agricultural chemistry.  The Pudovik reaction, used in this experiment to synthesize α-aryl-α-aminophosphonates and α-aryl-α-aminophosphine oxides, occurs when a >P(O)H species is added to the double bond of an imine.  The use of catalysts was seen with various solvents but more notably, variations were done in kitchen microwave ovens, which had not been done before to synthesize α-aryl-α-aminophosphine oxides.  Ultimately, both α-aryl-α-aminophosphonates and α-aryl-α-aminophosphine oxides were synthesized using the Pudovik reaction with no solvent and no catalyst, only microwave assisted.  In total, twenty-four derivates were isolates, six of which were new compounds.

"This research established a process for direct arylation of 2H-indazoles using aryl diazonium salts. The process through which this reaction occurs was found to be the aryl diazonium salt acting as an electron-acceptor to form the key ternary electron-donor-acceptor (EDA) complex. Then proceeding via a radical pathway with the photoexcitation of the EDA complex triggering SET to generate an aryl radical. This radical reacts, affording an intermediate. After oxidation and/ or deprotonation, dependant on the intermediate formed, the aromaticity is regenerated to produce the desired product. The optimal conditions for this process were determined as in the presence of pyridine in DMSO at room temperature under blue LED light irradiation (455 nm) in an Ar environment.

"Replication is a key process required for the evolution of life and it is probable that self-replicating molecules played a role in the origin of life. In living organisms, the replication process is not in equilibrium, resulting in uneven distributions of molecules. This unequal equilibrium could be the consequence of a whole range of factors, some impacting the equilibrium more significantly than others. With the use of small dynamic combinatorial libraries an investigation was carried out on two self-replicating macrocycles derived from peptides, competing for raw materials. The replication is driven by formation of fibers, made up of macrocycle monomers and stabilized with -sheets, promoting further formation. Mechanosensitivity, whether the sample is stirred or shaken influences which macrocycle is the more dominant one.

"Stereoselective semi-hydrogenation of alkynes to (E)-alkenes is important for chemical synthesis.

"N-methylation of amines provides useful materials for developing medicinal treatments, by introducing an N-methylation into a compound, this compound can penetrate through the blood-brain barrier, hence entering the CNS more easily, however, traditional approaches of N-methylation use hazardous materials such as iridium and achieve a low yield due to regioselectivity. An alternative method of N-methylation of amines has been developed to mitigate these problems. Through use of a hydrogen borrowing strategy a more efficient way of N-methylation presents itself. The general reaction involves an oxidation of methanol with a metal, forming a ketone, and the hydrogen which has been removed is bound to the metal in a borrowing like manner; the hydrogen is given back to the new imine which is formed from reductive amination of the ketone. Compounds can be altered from being O-methylated to N-methylated through this strategy with minimal use of hazardous materials or problems with regioselectivity.",0.6660463809967041,0.4615384638309479

Extensive testing of this mechanism shows that changes from the standard temperature and the concentration of AgNO3 (100°C, 50 mol%) causes a decrease in yield by up to 50%. The reaction demonstrates a new streamlined way of producing functionalized pyrrolines at a larger scale while still being more cost-efficient.

"To combat the issues of toxic chemicals and by-products, noble and precious metal catalysts, and expensive phosphorus ligands, a new method of alkylation of amines was devised. N-ethylation and N-methylation of a broad range of aliphatic and aromatic compounds were demonstrated using a (cyclopentadienone) iron tricarbonyl complex under basic conditions.

"C3 arylated 2H indazoles are useful in a variety of bioactive compounds including several pharmaceutical drugs. However, the synthesis of them is causing a problem in their ability to be used. The C3 position on a benzene ring is not the most accessible, and many reactions will preferentially arylate on a different location. To force the C3 position, must current reactions use heavy metal catalysts or photocatalysts. This article demonstrates a more environmentally friendly way of creating this reaction using visible light with no catalysts necessary. Using aryl diazonium salts, and the creation of an EDA complex is a new reaction mechanism which will work to create the C3 arylated 2H indazoles. Many different reaction pathways are considered, and the results of each is presented, but all of them use mild reaction conditions and do not need catalysts to proceed.",0.5578446388244629,0.38461539149284363

"Alkylated amines are important both in nature (adrenaline) and in medicine (antidepressants, anti-Pakinsonians and painkillers). Traditional methods of N-methylation involve Eschweiller-Clarke type reactions, the use of methylating agents such as iodomethane, palladium-form-aldehyde reductive amination or reduction of carbamates. These methods use toxic compounds and have low selectivity. We sought to develop the use of an Earth abundant metal catalyst for use in N-methylation. An Fe(0) complex worked well in N-ethylation of amines and in N-methylation of aromatic amines under basic conditions. In the presence of H2 gas, the complex was found to work in the N-methylation of aliphatic amines. Not only is the use of this complex more environmentally friendly than traditional methods, but it also preserves other functional groups. Computational methods were used to propose the mechanism for the Fe(0) complex catalyzed methylation of amines which highlighted the role of hydrogen pressure and the base in the reaction.",0.6558945775032043,0.9230769276618958
"N-methylation and N-ethylation of aliphatic and aromatic amines was found to have been catalysed by a four coordinated iron(0) complex comprised of three carbonyl ligands and an electron rich cycloepentadienone ligand. It was found that the complex catalysed the reactions under basic conditions. This iron-based catalyst is more economic and sustainable compared to current high efficiency catalysts. Methylation occurred on many of the aryl and aliphatic amines at high yields, with some undergoing dimethylation. The reaction undergoes a hydrogen autotransfer borrowing process, a pathway which utilizes easy to use reagents and produces water as a by-product. Evidence from density functional theory calculations supports the idea that molecular hydrogen acts not only as a reducing agent, but also acts in a way that shifts the thermodynamic equilibria of the reactions.",0.5963159799575806,0.7692307829856873
"Molecular self-assembly has become a recent area of interest in research, due to their potential importance in the early evolution of life. However, in contrast to typical kinetic conditions in biological systems, most of the self- assembling molecules researched so far are formed from systems in in thermodynamic equilibria. To investigate the factors driving the formation of different products in a new dynamic combinatorial library, samples of trimer and tetramer starting reagent were mechanically agitated in three different ways and analyzed the results over a period of days using GC-MS. It was found that the different modes of agitation- shaking, stirring or nothing, favored different products; either a heptamer, hexamer or original trimer and tetramer composed of alternating alpha amino acids. These results show that molecular self-assembly can be controlled by kinetics- a step in the understanding of self-replication in life, and that mechanical agitation can influence self-assembly reaction outcomes.",0.6916252970695496,0.38461539149284363

This article explores two self-replicating peptide macrocycles with alternating hydrophobic (leucine) and hydrophilic (lysine) α-amino acids from a combinatorial library. Peptides of this structure favor noncovalent assembly into fibers held together by β sheets, shown by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, circular dichroism, FTIR, UV and fluorescence spectroscopy. The product distribution was observed using liquid chromatography – mass spectrometry and it was shown to depend on the mechanical energy supplied and the mode of agitation, with shaking more efficient than stirring.

The hexamer and heptamer were shown to be formed of fibres in a b-sheet formation, which was crucial to self-replication and resulted in mechanosensitivity: the fibre structure prevented re-equilibration to other macrocyclic structures. Hexamer dominated under shaking whilst heptamer dominated under stirring due to differences in efficiency of fibre fragmentation, influencing exponential growth.

Addition of trimethyl groups and sulfur functionality can have a significant impact on the properties of heterocyclic molecules, which is beneficial in the drug discovery process.",0.250618040561676,0.38461539149284363
"Routes for direct, selective C-H transformations in organic compounds using readily available and abundant chemicals are essential in organic synthesis. First row transition metal catalysts have been employed for C-H functionalizations in non-aromatic compounds. However, a simple earth-abundant base metal catalyst system has yet to be developed for aromatic compounds, especially for atom-deficient C-H additions to multiple bonds. Fe(PMe3)4 proved an effective catalyst for the anti-Markovnikov addition of ortho C-H bonds in aromatic ketones to alkenes. A wide range of alkenes with varying additional functional groups can be used with this catalyst under mild conditions to produce high yields of the corresponding product. A deuterium exchange reaction also proved the C-H bond cleavage to not be the rate limiting step. The developed catalyst is earth-abundant and extensively useful for a range of reactions, therefore applications range across a number of industries.

"Due to the multistep sequences required for the formation of all-cis-multifluorinated cycloalkanes from diastereoselectively prefunctionalised precursors, not many have been prepared. These all-cis-multifluorinated alkanes show extremely high dipole moments perpendicular to the aromatic ring meaning they are widely desired for their unusual electronic properties. This paper shows a synthetic route to form these materials via the rhodium-cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC)-catalysed hydrogenation of fluorinated arenes in hexane which are freely available. This allows for a single-step preparation of a surplus of multisubstituted, multifluorinated cycloalkanes, for example all-cis-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexafluorocyclohexane and cis-configured fluorinated aliphatic heterocycles in a scalable fashion.",0.5969062447547913,0.5384615659713745
