Organometallics, 2020, 39, 2682-2694Abstract (maximum 150 words):Existing methods of organophosphine synthesis are often challenging as they require toxic starting materials, tedious separations and are unreliable in their outcome, it is generally only possible to efficiently and economically synthesise symmetrical phosphines. An alternative method, using alkali metal phosphides (R2PM; M=Na, Li, or K), formed in situ, in the preparation of organophosphines was studied. The synthesis of R2PNa, using sodium metal dispersed through mineral oil (SD), proved to be the most efficient, giving a higher yield than R2PLi and R2PK which produced no substantial yield. The R2PM compounds could be formedand reacted with ArCl in a single pot, R2PNa gave the highest yield (76%) followed by R2PK (43%), R2PLi gave no significant yield. Ph2PNa was notably found to readily react with ArCl with both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups in the para position, it was also possible to form unsymmetrical phosphines effectively, opening a wide range of applications.Number of times cited:2{Data taken from Web of Science on (14/03/2021)",0.3808078467845917,0.75

Abstract (maximum 150 words):  All-cis-(multi)fluorinated cycloalkanes are widely desired due to their highly polarised nature arising from aligned C-F bonds, however many routes to their synthesis involve lengthy multistep sequences. Direct hydrogenation of readily available fluoroarenes has been recognized as a convenient one-step alternative with high cis-stereoselectivity, however competing hydrodefluorination has inhibited progress with standard heterogeneous hydrogenation catalysts. We present a hydrogenation procedure utilizing a catalytic cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) rhodium complex in non-polar hexane which was found to greatly favour hydrogenation with high cis-selectivity. This method allows for a wide variety of all-cis-(multi)fluorinated cycloalkanes and heterocycles to be directly synthesised due to the hydrogenation tolerance of many functionalities and are anticipated to be useful building blocks in biologically important compounds, pharmaceuticals and materials.",0.745313823223114,0.800000011920929

Abstract (maximum 150 words):   A range of superior reactants and preparation procedures have been studied in association with the synthesis of high yield organophosphines from metal phosphides and aryl halides. Mechanistic pathways have been given following the reductive cleavage of R3P with sodium to produce R2PNa, which further underwent substitution with ArCl to generate R2PAr product. No catalyst was required. Sodium phosphide R2PNa can be prepared with reliable selectivity via C-P bond cleavage of di and triarylphosphines, as well as from reactions with phosphinites and chlorophosphines. R2PNa synthesis was most successful on comparison with other alkali metal substitutes, Li and K. ArCl reacted most efficiently with Ph2PNa when compared to other aryl halides, PhI and PhBr, in which low yields were retrieved. Aryl groups with electron-withdrawing groups accelerated the organophosphine synthesis reaction. Efficient reactions were observed with vinyl, alkyl, admantyl and menthyl chlorides, whilst sterically hindered t-butyl chlorides did not generate the desired product.",0.3460840880870819,0.800000011920929

There has been a variety of similar experiments considering earth abundant metals with mild reaction conditions, however none received the excellent yields and regioselectivity that this simple catalyst produced. The alkylation reaction found that the coupling of alkenes with the ortho C-H bonds in aromatic ketones was selectively favoured to produce linear alkylation products.

Abstract (maximum 150 words):   Sulfur compounds containing a tetrahydrothiophene ring system as a core structure have therapeutic applications, hence the demand for new tetrahydrothiophene derivatives is constantly growing at the biological, pharmacological, and medicinal chemistry level. The presence of a trifluoromethyl group is an example of this since it can cause changes in the physico-chemical properties of a molecule. However, not much could be found in the literature. For that reason, the aim of this study was to synthesize trifluoromethyl tetrahydrothiophene derivatives substituted with heteroatomic functional group. The approach for the synthesis consisted of using a [3+2]-cycloaddition reaction of a 1-functionalized 3,3,3-trifluoropropene derivative as dipolarophile with various 1,3 dipoles and thiocarbonyl ylide generated in situ from elimination of chloromethyl trimethylsilylmethyl sulfide. The findings of this study show the formation of a new 4-(trifluoromethyl)tetrahydrothiophenes with ester, sulfone, sulfoximine, sulfonamide, and phospohonate moiety.

An alternative method of N-methylation of amines has been developed to mitigate these problems. Through use of a hydrogen borrowing strategy a more efficient way of N-methylation presents itself. The general reaction involves an oxidation of methanol with a metal, forming a ketone, and the hydrogen which has been removed is bound to the metal in a borrowing like manner; the hydrogen is given back to the new imine which is formed from reductive amination of the ketone. Compounds can be altered from being O-methylated to N-methylated through this strategy with minimal use of hazardous materials or problems with regioselectivity.",0.6619415879249573,0.6000000238418579

Abstract (maximum 150 words):     C-F bonds are considered the most polarized single carbon bonds in organic chemistry due to their electrostatic character. This property is used in both pharmaceutical and agrochemical science to for example tweak polarity. If the C-F bond’s orientations are further controlled to be on the same face they can be used to design high polar complexes, such as all-cis-multifluorinated cycloalkanes, that can be applied to other scientific areas like material sciences. However, all-cis-multifluorinated cycloalkanes are complex to synthesize as they need multistep sequences from diastereoselectively prefunctionalized precursors. This study therefore postulated a one-step rhodium-cyclic (alkyl) (amino) carbene (CAAC) – catalysed hydrogenation pathway to be applied to fluorinated arenes in hexanes, to derive desired cis-fluorinated compounds. The one-step process allows the production of multiple multifluorinated and multisubstituted cycloalkanes such as cis-configured fluorinated aliphatic heterocycles and all-cis-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexafluorocyclohexane.",0.7130510210990906,0.75

Abstract (149 words):  Controlling the stereo- and chemoselectivity of the semihydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes is very difficult and often requires forcing and harsh reaction conditions or a platinum group metal catalyst. While this is effective, it is unsustainable on industrial levels, creating the need for abundant 3d transition metal catalysts that are effective at milder conditions, such as pre-formed Ni complexes. We focus particularly on the use of the PSiP-supported Ni hydride (iPr-PSiPInd)NiH complex in the formation of (E)-alkenes under 1 atm H2, 25-50C, and 1–2.5 mol % Ni. The use of this catalyst affords an atom-economical catalytic cycle that provides a high (E)-selectivity (E:Z 99:1) and tolerance of a diverse range of functional groups with no over-hydrogenation observed. This is achieved through the formation of alkenyl complex (iPr-PSiPInd)Ni(CPh=CHPh) and its reaction with H2 to afford the (Z)-alkene isomer, which subsequently readily undergoes -hydride elimination to generate the desired (E)-alkene.",0.708543062210083,0.800000011920929

The product distribution was observed using liquid chromatography – mass spectrometry and it was shown to depend on the mechanical energy supplied and the mode of agitation, with shaking more efficient than stirring.

Chen, Y. Bao, J. Zhou and B. Zhu, Chem. Commun., 2019, 55,14697-14700  Reference in ACS format   Chen, C.; Bao, Y.; Zhou, J.; Zhu, B. Chem. Commun. 2019, 55, 14697-14700.  Abstract (maximum 150 words):   Many imino-functionalisation reactions of γ,δ-unsaturated oxime esters have previously been carried out. However, the imino-phosphorylation of γ,δ-unsaturated oxime esters was yet to be observed. In this study γ,δ-unsaturated oxime esters were shown to have been converted to phosphorylated pyrrolines by imino-phosphorylation, using a cascade radical cyclisation mechanism. The process was shown to be economically viable and reduced the amount of waste products produced compared with previous mechanisms. The reaction was also shown to be effectively catalysed by AgNO3 to obtain good yields without the need of an oxidising agent. The reaction was shown to synthesise multiple phosphorylated pyrrolines, including previously hard to synthesise bulky phosphorylated pyrrolines, which have the future potential for use as reagents in further synthetic reactions.",0.7416333556175232,0.800000011920929

Kianmehr and S. B. Nasab, Eur. J. Org. Chem., 2018, 6447-6452.   Reference in ACS format:  Kianmehr, E.; Nasab, S. B. Eur. J. Org. Chem. 2018, 6447-6452.   Abstract (maximum 150 words): The nitration of aromatic derivatives forms products used in a variety of industries, including the pharmaceutical and petroleum. However, traditional methods have proven to be costly and have adverse by-products, with little control over the regioselectivity of the product. Here we provide a silver-catalysed synthesis for the C-H bond nitration of anilides in the ortho position using sodium nitrite as a commonly available source of NO2. The mechanism proceeds via C-H bond activation and is tolerated by both electron-donating and withdrawing functional groups on the aromatic ring. This approach allows products to be obtained in good yields while overcoming the limitations of traditional methods.",0.7458866834640503,0.800000011920929
