"Aims: The aims of the experiment were to synthesize and isolate SnI4 from its respective elements, and to investigate the compound�s reactivity and chemical behavior with tests. Procedure: Tin metal (1g) was added to a flask along with iodine pellets (2.5g), toluene (10cm3) and a few anti-bumping granules. This mixture was heated under reflux until the condensing solvent ran clear. The solvent in the flask was allowed to cool to the point where the solvent stopped condensing, and then was decanted. Petroleum spirit 40-60 (10cm3) was then added to the refluxed solvent. The residual tin metal left in the reaction flask was washed with acetone and then weighed. The solution in the flask was allowed to cool fully, and the crystals that formed were then filtered using vacuum filtration � the crystals were washed with cold petroleum spirit 40-60 throughout. Once the crystals were washed and dried, they were weighed. A solution was then made; a combination of the crystals (micro-spatula tip) and water (15mL). A sequence of tests was then carried out on the solution (1-2mL for each test); first being the addition of silver nitrate (0.1M, 4-5 drops). Then, for the second test, a copper wire was heated in a Bunsen flame, dipped into the solution, then placed back into the flame. For the last test, hydrogen peroxide (3%, 10 drops) and petroleum spirit 40-60 (2-3mL) were added to the solution.",0.770341157913208,0.7300000190734863
"The aim of the experiment was to prepare a tin iodide species from its elements and isolate it, then to test its reactivity. Tin metal (1.01 g) and iodine (2.49 g) were refluxed with toluene (10 cm3) until the vapor turned from violet to orange to colourless. The solution was decanted and petroleum 40/60 (10 cm3) was added. The residual tin was washed and weighed (0.49 g). The crystals were recrystallized and filtered through a B�chner funnel; the crystals obtained were orange (2.29 g).",0.4727233350276947,0.6499999761581421
"The aim of this experiment was to facilitate a reaction between tin metal and iodine to produce and recrystallize tin (IV) iodide. In addition to this, three tests were performed to determine the reactions between various chemicals and a solution created from the addition of water to a sample of the recrystallized SnI4. 1.31g of tin metal, 2.52g of iodine, and 10ml of toluene were added to a 100ml Quickfit round bottom flask. This mixture was heated using a hot plate and a reflux condenser. The mixture was heated until the mixture changed from its original deep violet colour to orange, and its vapour turned clear. Once the reaction was completed the mixture was transferred to a conical beaker and 10ml of petroleum spirit 40/60 was added. The beaker was then placed on ice to allow for recrystallization of the SnI4. Once the crystals had formed and the solution was cool the crystals were filtered out using a Buchner funnel facilitated by petroleum spirit 40/60. From this point the tests were conducted using a solution of a micro spatula tip of SnI4 added to 20ml water that were thoroughly mixed. The first test consisted of 1-2ml of this solution being transferred to a test tube and then adding 4-5 drops of 0.1M silver nitrate, which was then shaken gently. The second test was conducted by placing a copper wire in the flame of a Bunsen Burner and noting the flame's colour. Then the same copper wire was dipped into the SnI4 and water solution and placed back in the flame. The colour was once again noted. Finally, another 1-2ml of the solution were placed in a test tube and 10 drops of 3% hydrogen peroxide were added and the colour noted, then 2-3 ml of petroleum spirit 40/60 was added to the same test tube and the colour and biphasic separation was noted. All chemicals and solutions were disposed of in the appropriate containers.",0.8394041657447815,0.7799999713897705
"The aim of this experiment was to prepare a tin iodine species, Sn(IV) iodide, from its elements tin and iodine, as well as to test the reactivity of the resulting product by performing a series of tests. Preparing Sn(IV) iodide: Tin metal (1.0g), iodine pellets (2.5g), and toluene (10 cm3) were added to a 100mL round-bottom flask along 2 or 3 anti-bumping granules. The reaction flask was connected to a reflux condenser and clamped in a heating mantle. The solution was heated to the point where violet vapor became clear and the solution became orange. The solution was decanted into a 100 cm3 conical flask then left to cool at room temperature. The tin residue left in the reaction flask was washed with petroleum spirit 40/60 and cooled, then washed with acetone and dried. The crystallized solution in the conical flask was filtered off with a Buchner funnel and washed with cold petroleum spirit 40/60. Both the tin residue and dried crystals were weighed. Chemical tests: The SnI4 crystals were mixed in water (15~20 mL) and shaken until the solid was no longer visible. The pH was checked by dipping a glass rod in the flask and spotting onto pH paper. For Test 1, 1~2 mL of the solution was transferred to a test tune and mixed with silver nitrate (4~5 drops, 0.1M). The mixture was gently shaken and observed. For Test 2, 1~2mL of the solution was transferred to a test tube. A heated copper wire was immersed in the solution and then heated in a Bunsen flame. For Test 3, 1~2 mL of the solution was transferred to a test tube and mixed with hydrogen peroxide (10 drops, 3%). The solution was shaken for 30 seconds and mixed with petrol (2~3 mL). The biphasic solution was gently swirled.",0.820073664188385,0.7799999713897705

"This experiment was aimed at preparing a sample of tin iodide (SnI4) from its constituent elements, isolating the product and using chemical tests to investigate its reactivity. Procedure Toluene (10cm3) was added to a mixture of iodine (2.5g) and tin (1.0g). The resultant mixture was heated under reflux until the condensing solvent became clear and the initially purple solution turned orange. The reaction flask was allowed to cool until the solvent stopped condensing. The hot solution was then decanted to separate it from the residual tin metal. Petroleum spirit 40/60 (10cm3) was added to the hot solution before it was allowed to cool to room temperature. The residual tin was washed with acetone, dried and then weighed. When orange crystals began to form in the solution, it was put in an ice bath for 5 minutes to maximise crystallisation. The crystals were filtered out of the solution under suction and then washed using petroleum spirit 40/60 (10cm3). They were then allowed to dry and weighed. The product (heaped microspatula) was dissolved in water (20 mL). The pH of the resulting solution was then tested using pH paper. Three more chemical tests were performed on the resulting solution. In test one, silver nitrate (5 drops, 0.1M) was added to the solution (2mL). Test 2 was the �Beilstein� test where a glowing hot copper rod was immersed into the solution (2mL) and heated to test. In the final test,  Hydrogen peroxide (10 drops, 3%w/v) was added to the solution (2mL). It was then shaken and petrol(3mL)",0.7801065444946289,0.8799999952316284
"The aim of this experiment was to form tin (IV) iodine (SnI4) from tin and iodine and investigate the reactivity of the tin iodide formed. 1.10g of tin, 2.48g of iodine and 10cm3 of toluene were heated under reflux with 3 anti-bumping granules.
