Abstract (maximum 150 words):  Replication is essential for the origin of life, but how it emerged is still a mystery. It is known that molecules can self-replicate by kinetically controlled autocatalysis; however, these systems are very simple compared to organisms with complex internal organization, so what factors move replication forward the most is under investigation. By using a small dynamic combinatorial library, two self-replicating peptide-derived macrocycles are reported. It is found that macrocycles are capable of promoting their own formation, while forming extended assemblies held together with ùõΩ-sheet type structures. Furthermore, the mode of agitation (shaking and stirring) influences which replicator dominates. These findings imply that mechanical forces can determine which products are formed when there are multiple replicators available and how far a covalent synthesis goes.",0.7332108616828918,0.75

Abstract (maximum 150 words):   Sulfur compounds containing a tetrahydrothiophene ring system as a core structure have therapeutic applications, hence the demand for new tetrahydrothiophene derivatives is constantly growing at the biological, pharmacological, and medicinal chemistry level. The presence of a trifluoromethyl group is an example of this since it can cause changes in the physico-chemical properties of a molecule. However, not much could be found in the literature. For that reason, the aim of this study was to synthesize trifluoromethyl tetrahydrothiophene derivatives substituted with heteroatomic functional group. The approach for the synthesis consisted of using a [3+2]-cycloaddition reaction of a 1-functionalized 3,3,3-trifluoropropene derivative as dipolarophile with various 1,3 dipoles and thiocarbonyl ylide generated in situ from elimination of chloromethyl trimethylsilylmethyl sulfide. The findings of this study show the formation of a new 4-(trifluoromethyl)tetrahydrothiophenes with ester, sulfone, sulfoximine, sulfonamide, and phospohonate moiety. This was supported via the use of NMR, mass-spectrometry, melting points, and chromatography.",0.8393197655677795,0.699999988079071

Abstract (maximum 150 words):  This paper outlines a novel approach to the synthesis of nitrated anilides via a regioselective silver-catalysed pathway. Ortho-selective C-H functionalization was achieved using sodium nitrate as a nitrating agent in the presence of K2S2O8 which achieved good yields with both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituents. The proposed mechanism starts with the initial formation of an arylsilver complex and proceeds through radical intermediates to produce the ortho-nitrated products. The nitration of aromatic sulphonamides via this mechanism was also successfully demonstrated. Ortho-nitrated anilides are difficult to access through traditional approaches and this procedure provides an efficient way to synthesis this critical organic precursor for the pharmaceutical and dye industry.",0.6426430344581604,0.8500000238418579

Methylation occurred on many of the aryl and aliphatic amines at high yields, with some undergoing dimethylation. The reaction undergoes a hydrogen autotransfer borrowing process, a pathway which utilizes easy to use reagents and produces water as a by-product.

Abstract (maximum 150 words):   A range of superior reactants and preparation procedures have been studied in association with the synthesis of high yield organophosphines from metal phosphides and aryl halides. Mechanistic pathways have been given following the reductive cleavage of R3P with sodium to produce R2PNa, which further underwent substitution with ArCl to generate R2PAr product. No catalyst was required. Sodium phosphide R2PNa can be prepared with reliable selectivity via C-P bond cleavage of di and triarylphosphines, as well as from reactions with phosphinites and chlorophosphines. R2PNa synthesis was most successful on comparison with other alkali metal substitutes, Li and K. ArCl reacted most efficiently with Ph2PNa when compared to other aryl halides, PhI and PhBr, in which low yields were retrieved. Aryl groups with electron-withdrawing groups accelerated the organophosphine synthesis reaction. Efficient reactions were observed with vinyl, alkyl, admantyl and menthyl chlorides, whilst sterically hindered t-butyl chlorides did not generate the desired product.",0.8668822646141052,0.800000011920929

Processes describing the direct formation of (E)-alkenes are limited and so the identification of an abundant transition metal catalyst for their direct hydrogenation using molecular H2 would represent a valuable advance.  In this study we investigated whether bis(phosphino)silyl Ni hydride complex (iPr-PSiPInd)NiH, designated as Complex 1, could act as this suitable catalyst. We tested complex 1 against a wide range of diaryl alkynes, SiMe3-protected alkynes and internal alkynes; all of these were found to be reactive except internal alkynes with ketone or ester substitution.

J. Martin, B. Q. Mercado and J. M. Mayer, J. Org. Chem., 2019, 84, 12172-12176.  Reference in ACS format: Martin, D. J.; Mercado, B. Q.; Mayer, J. M. J. Org. Chem. 2019, 84, 12172-12176.  Abstract (maximum 150 words):   Substituted 2,6-dinitrobenzaldehydes are valuable synthetic intermediates used in the preparations of dyes, pigments, and macrocycles. They have been prepared by several methods and characterised by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and singe-crystal X-ray structures. The synthesis of 4-tert-butyl-2,6-dinitrobenzaldehyde was reported via the nitration and oxidation of 4-tert-butylbenzylalcohol, but single-crystal X-ray data revealed that it was the 3,5-dinitro isomer, 4-tert-butyl-3,5-dinitrobenzaldehyde isomer that was formed instead. Another previously reported synthesis using chromium reagents and chromatography purification is reported to produce the 2,6-isomer, 4-tert-butyl-2,6-dinitrobenzaldehyde. Adapted methods in this paper include a high yield synthesis of the 3,5-dinitro isomer and a high yield, high-throughput synthesis of the 2,6-isomer which demonstrates improved methods of synthesis for the large-scale production of both isomers.",0.8095252513885498,0.800000011920929

Kwiatkowski, T.D. Beeson, J.C. Conrad and W.C. MacMillan, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2011, 133, 1738-1741.  Reference in ACS format:   Kwiatkowski, P.; Beeson, T.D.; Conrad, J.C.; MacMillan, D.W.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2011, 133, 1738-1741.  Abstract (maximum 150 words):  The enantioselective Œ±-fluorination of ketones has been achieved with organocatalysis. Previously, this has been accomplished in aldehydes with the Œ±-fluoro aldehyde product obtained by enamine catalysis, however, this has not been translated to ketones due to slow condensation with secondary amine catalysts and little control for enamine organization. To address these issues with enamine activation, analysis of a range of amine catalysts was carried out resulting in a Cinchona-based alkaloid catalyst. This primary amine catalyst has facilitated asymmetric and direct Œ±-fluorination in an array of carbo- and hetero-cyclic ketone substrates, in addition to providing enantio-, regio-, chemo-, and diastereoselective control.",0.7314850687980652,0.800000011920929
