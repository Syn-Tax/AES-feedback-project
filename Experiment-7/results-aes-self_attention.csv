Abstract (maximum 150 words):   Rice fermentation by different lactic acid bacteria (LAB) produces a variety of volatile and non-volatile components that act as flavourants in rice-based beverages. 12 strains of LAB were studied to identify the volatile and non-volatile components produced from each strain. Rice samples were fermented with different LAB strains. Volatile products were identified by solid phase micro-extraction, whereas non-volatile products by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In total, 47 volatile and 37 non-volatile components were identified. Generally, obligatorily heterofermentative LAB and obligatorily homofermentative LAB significantly differed in the level of ethanol produced and in the volatile and non-volatile components produced. The profiles of components produced from principal component analysis demonstrated that the rice strains were distinguishable by the LAB strains they were fermented in. Identifying the components produced by different LAB allows production of better quality rice-based products as a dairy replacement especially in Asian countries with rice as a staple food.",0.7715027332305908,0.75

Abstract (maximum 150 words):  The synthesis of (E)-alkenes from alkynes via selective semihydrogenation is a regularly used process in both small-scale synthesis and industrial processes. Processes such as Birch-type reduction are currently in use for this synthesis but exhibited complications such as: harsh reaction conditions, limited range of functional group tolerance and requiring a multistep process. Research into developing a mechanism capable of eliminate such issues lead to the discovery of the bis(phosphino)silyl Ni hydride complex (iPr-PSiPInd)NiH [1] as a pre-catalyst for such a reaction. Catalytic and stoichiometric experiments were used to better understand how [1] successfully carries out these reactions. [1] is shown to be involved during the hydrogenation and isomerization steps of the reaction.

Abstract: Compounds containing N-methylated and ethylated amines are effective in crossing the blood-brain barrier in the human body, making methods of adding this functionality useful in the development of drugs which target the brain and CNS. However, conventional synthesis methods have typically employed the use of toxic reagents such as formaldehyde or expensive rare earth metal-based catalysts containing phosphine ligands, making safer and more sustainable methods sought after. The paper reports on a method for the addition of methyl and ethyl groups to amines under mildly basic conditions, utilizing a catalyst made from earth-abundant iron. The mechanism for the reaction occurs through a ‚Äòhydrogen auto-transfer‚Äô process, wherein the catalyst deprotonates the alcohol, which undergoes a condensation reaction with the target amine, producing an imine. The catalyst transfers the hydrogen to the formed imine, minimizing side-product formation caused by self-condensation, producing methylated and ethylated amines in high yields.",0.7895854115486145,0.8500000238418579

The synthesis of 4-tert-butyl-2,6-dinitrobenzaldehyde was reported via the nitration and oxidation of 4-tert-butylbenzylalcohol, but single-crystal X-ray data revealed that it was the 3,5-dinitro isomer, 4-tert-butyl-3,5-dinitrobenzaldehyde isomer that was formed instead.

Abstract (maximum 150 words):  An efficient method for the nitration of aromatic derivatives is necessary since nitroarenes have many applications in various areas. There are lots of metal-mediated methods which can be used for nitration but these use large quantities of metal which is expensive. There are also less methods to nitrate anilides and previously none of these involved using silver complexes which are much cheaper. Because of this, an investigation was performed to determine an effective method for nitrating anilines utilizing silver. After many different experiments, varying different parameters, the conclusion could be drawn that the most effective method for the nitration of anilides uses sodium nitrite in the presence of K2S2O8 (as the oxidant) in acetonitrile at 110¬∞C, with a silver based catalyst (10 mol-% of AgNO2 gave the best yield).

Various iodionitrene compounds were used for comparison in order to derive a possible mechanism for the reaction. The formation of a 1,4-biradical intermediate allows for the C-C bond of the cyclobutane product to be formed sterospecifically . This intermediate is generated through the 1,1-diazene intermediate from the electrophilic amination of pyrrolidine with  a iodonitrene compound in situ.

Abstract (maximum 150 words):   Tetrahydrothiophene is sulfur containing ring structure that appears in many biological molecules with a range of biological activities. Trifluoromethyl as well as other sulfur or phosphorus containing substituents introduced in the heterocycle may change the properties of the heterocyclic molecule substantially.

In this article a convenient synthetic route of 4-(trifluoromethyl)tetrahydrothiophene with various heteroatomic substituents at third position is shown. 3,4-trans-disubstituted tetrahydrothiophenes are produced by cycloaddition of alkenes containing the trifluoromethyl group to in situ generated thiocarbonyl ylide. Some of the products are further converted to the corresponding S-oxides, S,S-dioxides and S-imino-S-oxides by oxidation and oxidative imination.

However, it is unclear where it originated as it does not follow a thermodynamic path towards equilibrium. To investigate its possible emergence, a dynamic combinatorial library was set up using dithiol and alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic Œ±-amino acid building blocks, leucine, and lysine respectively. The mixture was observed under pH 8 and agitation, both stirring and shaking. It was shown through characterization that there was significant formation of macro √ü-sheet structures, with agitation increasing their amount. From this a schematic model of self-organisation was proposed with two main processes: elongation of fibres; and breakage of them, which exponentially increased the amount. Differences in formation of heptamer versus hexamer show formation being kinetically determined in the fibre growing phase. These findings support the notion that kinetic products can result from reversible processes if non-covalent interactions are dominant enough.",0.7310948967933655,0.6499999761581421

Chem. 2018, 2018 (46), 6447-6452. https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejoc.201800779 (accessed March 14, 2021).    Abstract (maximum 150 words): Previous methods of regioselecting nitrating aromatic derivatives used expensive nitrate salt reagents, were hard to prepare and generated high quantities of by products. A more efficient way of nitrating these aromatic derivatives has been developed, by using AgNO2 as the catalyst, CH3CN as the solvent and K2S2O8 as the oxidant. The use of these molecules allows the efficient regioselective nitration of an ortho C-H bond within an anilide. This allows a cheaper, simpler and more efficient synthesis of drug precursors, utilizing commonly available materials.",0.6411489248275757,0.550000011920929

Abstract (maximum 150 words):  Isochromans are cyclic organic compounds containing a benzyl ring joined with a furan. The different methods that had been used to synthesise them always involved strong Lewis acids such as TiCl4, AlCl3, and SnCl4 or HCl as catalysts. The procedure outlined here follows the Oxa-Pictet Spengler reaction pathway (nucleophilic attack of an aldehyde or ketone by phenyl-ethanol, then intramolecular Friedel-Crafts acylation), making use of a milder Lewis acid in milder general conditions to afford a wide range of isochromans with yields rarely subceeding 95%, while having H2O as the only by-product. Which, it must be said, remains rare in synthesis of significant compounds.",0.6902408003807068,0.8500000238418579
