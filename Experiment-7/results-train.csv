DOI: 10.1126/science.aao0270   Abstract (maximum 150 words): Fluorine-carbon bonds are very strong bonds due to the high electronegativity of fluorine. Which leads to a large dipole moment, ideal for many polar reactions in material chemistry. Therefore, a greater polarity from cis-fluoro-arenes is highly applicable and valued and optimized synthesis reactions are intriguing. Previously, production of cis-fluoro-arenes have given low yields, required large quantities of catalysts and resulted in unwanted diastereoisomers. A new proposed method of synthesis is hydrogenation, which can be applied to a large variety of reagents, uses minimal catalysts, 0.5 - 1%, and gives high yields of the products. This method gives access to highly polar compounds and considers diastereoselectivity in a single step as well as ensuring hydrodefluorination does not occur.",0.7261931300163269,0.6000000238418579

There has been a variety of similar experiments considering earth abundant metals with mild reaction conditions, however none received the excellent yields and regioselectivity that this simple catalyst produced. The alkylation reaction found that the coupling of alkenes with the ortho C-H bonds in aromatic ketones was selectively favoured to produce linear alkylation products. A broad variety of alkenes were discovered to be applicable for this mechanism: an enamine, vinylsilanes, styrenes and aliphatic terminal alkenes all produced high yields. Significantly, for the first time, the reaction of aromatic ketones with enol ethers afforded the highly yielding predominant formation of anti-Markovnikov addition products (up to 97%).",0.7824694514274597,0.75

Mechanosensitive Self-Replication Driven By Self-Organization. Science 2010, 327 (5972), 1502-1506.   Abstract:  Self-replication is a crucial part of Darwinian evolution. However, it is unclear where it originated as it does not follow a thermodynamic path towards equilibrium. To investigate its possible emergence, a dynamic combinatorial library was set up using dithiol and alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic α-amino acid building blocks, leucine, and lysine respectively. The mixture was observed under pH 8 and agitation, both stirring and shaking. It was shown through characterization that there was significant formation of macro ß-sheet structures, with agitation increasing their amount. From this a schematic model of self-organisation was proposed with two main processes: elongation of fibres; and breakage of them, which exponentially increased the amount. Differences in formation of heptamer versus hexamer show formation being kinetically determined in the fibre growing phase. These findings support the notion that kinetic products can result from reversible processes if non-covalent interactions are dominant enough.",0.7134547233581543,0.6499999761581421

Abstract (maximum 150 words):         Replication is a key process required for the evolution of life and it is probable that self-replicating molecules played a role in the origin of life. In living organisms, the replication process is not in equilibrium, resulting in uneven distributions of molecules. This unequal equilibrium could be the consequence of a whole range of factors, some impacting the equilibrium more significantly than others. With the use of small dynamic combinatorial libraries an investigation was carried out on two self-replicating macrocycles derived from peptides, competing for raw materials. The replication is driven by formation of fibers, made up of macrocycle monomers and stabilized with -sheets, promoting further formation. Mechanosensitivity, whether the sample is stirred or shaken influences which macrocycle is the more dominant one. These findings suggest the outcome of covalent synthesis reactions can be determined by mechanical forces selecting for one replicator over another.",0.7271831035614014,0.6499999761581421

Different LAB produce various volatile and non-volatile flavour compounds, however the variation and metabolic formation of these products is not well known. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and solid-phase microextraction identified 47 volatile products of rice fermentation, including acids, aldehydes, esters and other common organic compounds. 37 non-volatile products, including amino acids, organic acids and carbohydrates, were characterised by gas chromatography-time-of-flight/ mass spectrometry. It was found that the products of rice fermentation differed significantly between obligatory heterofermentative and facultatively heterofermentative/ obligatorily homofermentative LAB, particularly the amounts of ethanol, 3-hydroxybutan-2-one and butane-2,3-dione. This can be accounted for by different metabolic pathways. Principle component analysis showed that fermented rice samples can be categorised into different LAB strains.

An alternative method of N-methylation of amines has been developed to mitigate these problems. Through use of a hydrogen borrowing strategy a more efficient way of N-methylation presents itself. The general reaction involves an oxidation of methanol with a metal, forming a ketone, and the hydrogen which has been removed is bound to the metal in a borrowing like manner; the hydrogen is given back to the new imine which is formed from reductive amination of the ketone. Compounds can be altered from being O-methylated to N-methylated through this strategy with minimal use of hazardous materials or problems with regioselectivity.",0.7559029459953308,0.6000000238418579

This procedure tolerates the use of varying electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups on N-protected indoles and iodoarenes. However, electron-withdrawing groups present on N-protected indoles tend to react slower than the unprotected indoles and relatively do not yield as much. This protocol also exhibits the use of deactivated indole rings without any significant issues and tolerance to the presence of other halogen atoms. Potential for this protocol to be scaled up was displayed by performing the synthesis in the gram scale.

This allowed for Pd(II) catalyzed regioselective direct C-2 arylation by cross coupling of N-protected and unprotected indoles with iodoarenes. With Pd(OAc)2 as the catalyst the yields were as high as 99% and with PEG-400 as the milling auxiliary the reactions were completed within 2 hours. Although the reaction was tested with both electron withdrawing and electron donating groups, a strong electron withdrawing group reduced the reaction times to 1 hour and ensured yield greater than 90%. The reaction was successfully completed on a gram scale in a time of 1.5 hours with only a marginally lower yield, demonstrating the scalability of the reaction.  Overall, the reactions under mechanochemical milling were achieved in a shorter time with higher yields and less environmental damages, making it a more efficient process than previously tested methods.",0.7147400975227356,0.800000011920929

Developing an efficient method to prepare nitroarene has been of peak interest. This investigation examines the regioselective C-H ortho-nitration of anilides involving silver-catalysts to synthesize substituted ortho-nitro anilines. In this experiment, N-phenylacetamide was chosen as the substrate and sodium nitrate as the nitrating agent. The optimized reaction conditions were established: at 110°C, using an AgNO2 or AgNO3 catalyst led to higher yields of the product with K2S2O8 as the oxidant in acetonitrile organic solvent. It was found that the reaction tolerated various anilides – those with more electron-donating groups generally produced higher yield. A simple yet efficient silver-catalyzed method for regioselective ortho nitration of anilides via C-H bond activation was conclusively developed. The reaction is suitable for many substrates with good tolerance of electron-rich functional groups, and the resulting products have applications in pharmaceutical and petroleum industries.",0.8042525053024292,0.6499999761581421

Abstract (maximum 150 words):  A published method of synthesis asserts to have afforded the compound 4-tert-butyl-2,6-dinitrobenzaldehyde, but instead had synthesised the compound 4-tert-butyl-3,5-dinitrobenzaldehyde. This creates a problem as the 2,6-dinitro isomer is a lot more useful in chemistry and is used to prepare a number of dyes, pigments and other macromolecules. This incorrect method of synthesis has also been cited by articles, leading to another incorrect synthesis and misidentification of the compound tetrakis-5,10,15,20-(4′-tert-butyl-3′,5′- dinitrophenyl) porphyrin.

Abstract (147 words):  The presence of a tetrahydrothiophene ring system, in heterocyclic molecules containing sulphur, influences the biological and physio-chemistry of the molecule which can be exploited for medicinal applications.  Publication regarding the properties and derivation of trifluoromethyl tetrahydrothiophene compounds substituted with heteroatomic functional groups are limited in number and the synthesis routes described are often inaccessible.  Thus this paper describes the synthesis of 3-functional 4-trifluoromethyl-tetrahydrothiophenes, which is initiated by producing thiocarbonyl ylide from the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of electron-deficient alkenes; this occurs in situ by elimination of chloromethyl trimethylsilylmethyl sulphide (which is prepared from trimethylsilylmethanethiol, 1,3,5-trioxane and gaseous hydrochloric acid ) and the reaction proceeds under reflux in the presence of acetonitrile,  1.5-fold excess sulphide and 2-fold excess caesium fluoride.  The approach has good yields of 3-functional 4-trifluoromethyl-tetrahydrothiophenes which are composed of only the trans stereoisomer. Thus, the paper bring advancement to the understanding to the derivation of 3-functional 4-trifluoromethyl-tetrahydrothiophenes.

Traditional methods use concentrated sulfuric and nitric acids, where reaction conditions are harsh and have low tolerance for other functional groups. They were replaced by using nitrate salt reagents, which can be difficult to prepare and, from the resultant metal oxides, have a low atom economy. More recent methods use AgNO2 to selectively nitrate arenes, but this method uses high quantities of rare metals, which is unsustainable.  This reaction uses NaNO2 and K2S2O8 in CH3CN, using catalytic AgNO2, to selectively nitrate the ortho positions on a variety of arenes, displaying high regioselectivity and chemoselectivity as well as moderate to high yields with a selection of substitutions on the starting anilide.

Abstract (maximum 150 words):  A direct method has been reported for the first time for the stereoselective synthesis of multi-substituted cyclobutanes. Unlike previously used synthesis methods such as [2+2] cycloaddition, radical cyclisation, and ring contraction extrusion, this allows for the novel product of cyclobutanes with heterocyclic substituents. A possible mechanism has been proposed for this synthesis involving an initial reaction between the pyrrolidine and iodonitrene species to form a 1,1-diazene. Subsequent elimination of N2, mediated by nitrogen extrusion to generate a 1,4-biradical product which undergoes rapid cyclisation yielding the cyclobutene product is suggested. The viability of this method is proven through the formal synthesis of piperabronine B outlined in this paper. Beyond this, optimum temperature conditions are explored in optimizing the solubility of the starting material and intermediates. Despite these optimized conditions, yield varies from low to good, ranging from 24-42% for pyrrolidines with ⍺-heteroarene substituents, and 42-88% for pyrrolidines with ⍺-aryl substituents.    149 words",0.7581042051315308,0.6499999761581421

Abstract:  200014937 Isochromans are heterocyclic compounds utilised in pharmaceuticals for therapeutic applications, such as proton therapy. Numerous synthetic routes based on the oxa-Pictet-Spengler reaction have been established to produce substituted isochromans. However, these require costly conditions to synthesise a low-yield whilst forming toxic side products. The aim is to determine a more cost-effective method to produce a high yield of isochromans without damaging the environment. Here we show that the iron catalyst, Fe(OTf)2, gives the highest yield of product at a low concentration of 1 mol% compared to more toxic Brønsted and Lewis acids. Fe(OTf)2 produces isochromans and the side product of water, so is environmentally benign. The reaction involves a relatively low temperature of 70ºC and reaction period of 4 hours with the Fe(OTf)2 and toluene solvent to give a high yield of 99%. These economic conditions and environmentally-friendly reaction provides a more accessible way to produce isochromans for pharmaceutical compounds.",0.7370719909667969,0.8999999761581421

Bi-functional alkenes – such as α/β unsaturated amides, esters, and ketones – show conversion of the alkene with tolerance to other present functional groups resulting in a wide substrate pool.  From reactivity with free radical scavenger, TEMPO, TEMPO-CF3 is obtained suggesting a radical mechanism where base activated CF3SO2Cl yields CF3•, allowing the alkene to capture the radical and be quenched through copper binding, and further reductive elimination to produce the chlorotrifluoromethylated product.  This advances on from other CF3• yielding substrates which possess low boiling points – such as CF3I -  and therefore exist in a gaseous state and excessive gas manipulation techniques are required; allowing production of a more efficient method of chlorotrifluoromethylation.",0.7428424954414368,0.800000011920929

However, one which has not been extensively researched is synthesis of cyclobutanes from pyrrolidines. Application of previous research demonstrating the electrophilic nitrogen transfer properties of iodonitrene compounds, produced stereospecific cyclobutane compound successfully upon reactions with pyrrolidine. Various iodionitrene compounds were used for comparison in order to derive a possible mechanism for the reaction. The formation of a 1,4-biradical intermediate allows for the C-C bond of the cyclobutane product to be formed sterospecifically . This intermediate is generated through the 1,1-diazene intermediate from the electrophilic amination of pyrrolidine with  a iodonitrene compound in situ. This method was successfully used to synthesis Piperarborenine B and suggests the possible future use of this mechanism with pyrrolidines for cyclobutane formation.",0.7881474494934082,0.699999988079071

Abstract (maximum 150 words):  Stereoselective semi-hydrogenation of alkynes to (E)-alkenes is important for chemical synthesis. This is challenging due to competition between the formation of E and Z -isomers and the risk of over hydrogenation, resulting in the formation of alkanes. Previously, examples of platinum group metal-mediated catalyst have been found to selectively catalyze semi-hydrogenation of alkynes to (E)-alkenes however, a more abundant 3d metal-based alternative with a higher atom economy is highly sought after. This study found that the bis(phosphino)silyl Ni complex (iPr-PSiPInd)NiH was able to E-selectively catalyze the semi-hydrogenation of a range of substituted diaryl alkynes and SiMe3-protected terminal alkynes under mild conditions with relatively high functional group tolerance. This was achieved via a tandem reaction during which the alkyne was first semi-hydrogenated to a (Z)-alkene then subsequently isomerized to the (E)-alkene. Less electron rich substrates were found to undergo isomerization less readily yet in some cases controlling temperature improved selectivity.",0.6852242946624756,0.8500000238418579

The optimal conditions for the reaction are characterised using diethyl H-phosphonate as a substrate. The highest yield is observed when AgNO3 is used as a catalyst under oxidant-free conditions, with the yield being dependent on the salt concentration. The reactivity of different alkyl phosphonates and phosphine oxides under the optimised conditions is further investigated. As it is more efficient than the currently used strategies, this novel method has the potential to improve the synthesis of phosphorylated pyrrolines and especially, of bulky phosphine ligands, containing a pyrroline motif.",0.8347366452217102,0.8500000238418579

This repeating amino acid motif favors the formation of β-sheet structures.

The size of the products ring size is based on the use of mechanical force. Without mechanical agitation cyclic trimer and tetramer were the primary products.

However, life is far from a system in equilibrium, and it is debated which factors drive replication towards the conditions observed in living organisms. Cyclic self-replicating peptides, a hexamer and heptamer, were investigated under differing mechanical agitations – no agitation, stirring and shaking – in the presence of the thermodynamic trimer and tetramer mixture. The hexamer and heptamer were shown to be formed of fibres in a b-sheet formation, which was crucial to self-replication and resulted in mechanosensitivity: the fibre structure prevented re-equilibration to other macrocyclic structures. Hexamer dominated under shaking whilst heptamer dominated under stirring due to differences in efficiency of fibre fragmentation, influencing exponential growth. The results demonstrated that mechanical forces can influence which replicators dominate, and this shift towards kinetic control was crucial to the evolution of life.",0.8103527426719666,0.800000011920929

The optimum temperature for the Pudovik reaction was found to be 100˚C but this varied depending on the product being made. Further study identified and characterized the products - of which eighteen were novel compounds. The reaction mechanism was found by Density Functional Theory calculations. An X-ray study on two α-aminophosphonates found the molecules formed centrosymmetric dimers that are formed through hydrogen bonding between N–H groups and O=P groups. Overall, this new synthesis method was effective and gave high yields of α-aryl-α-aminophosphonates and α-aryl-α-aminophosphine oxides which have agricultural (such as fungisides), medicinal (as antivirals) and synthetic uses.",0.8431504368782043,0.8500000238418579

Abstract:  Terminal alkynes are of high synthetic value and amongst several transformations, the formation of unique C-O bonds via carboxylic acid addition reactions is of great importance. This study aimed to test the performance of ammonium tagged Hoveyda-Grubbs catalysts immobilized on magnetically separable core/shell silica supports for such reactions. The effect on selectivity and yield of varying parameters including different alkyne and acid compatibility, solvent, atmosphere and temperature were investigated. The catalytic system was found to be robust and air-tolerant with a high selectivity for the E-isomer using arylacetylene derivatives, yielding conversion values up to 99%. High conversion values were still obtained using sterically hindered ortho-substituted alkynes. The catalyst was found to be highly reusable using phenylacetylene in toluene under air atmosphere at 85°C.

To force the C3 position, must current reactions use heavy metal catalysts or photocatalysts. This article demonstrates a more environmentally friendly way of creating this reaction using visible light with no catalysts necessary. Using aryl diazonium salts, and the creation of an EDA complex is a new reaction mechanism which will work to create the C3 arylated 2H indazoles.

Abstract (maximum 150 words): The electronic properties of cis-multifluorinated cycloalkanes, particularly the highly polarised and highly desired C-F bond, mean such compounds are sought after by the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and material science industries. A synthetic route is discussed via the catalytic hydrogenation of fluoroarenes to the advantageous cis-(multi)fluorinated cycloalkanes. Herein, a highly selective pathway for the hydrogenation of a broad scope of (multi)fluorinated arenes and heteroarenes, hence offering access to cis-diastereoselectively (multi)fluorinated building blocks, highly polar all-cis-(multi)fluorocycloalkanes, and fluorinated aliphatic heterocycles is described. We used preliminary mechanistic experiments to investigate the observed increase in selectivity for the hydrogenated product versus the hydrofluorinated side product by changing the polarity of the solvent; for example, the selectivity using a polar solvent such as methanol (1:9) was compared to that of the less polar solvent dichloromethane (5:1).

To bypass this, an electron rich iron complex was used as a catalyst in a hydrogen borrowing reaction under basic conditions. The reaction between ethanol and multiple anilines and aliphatic amines gave high yields of the N-ethylated product (Scheme 1). The methylation reaction conditions had to be optimized with CsOH (Table 1) to conduct reactions on 12 aromatic amine substrates with numerous functional groups. The reaction provided moderate/excellent yields of the N-methylated product without reduction of the functional groups or methylation at the α-position (Scheme 2).

Abstract (maximum 150 words):  An efficient method for the nitration of aromatic derivatives is necessary since nitroarenes have many applications in various areas. There are lots of metal-mediated methods which can be used for nitration but these use large quantities of metal which is expensive. There are also less methods to nitrate anilides and previously none of these involved using silver complexes which are much cheaper. Because of this, an investigation was performed to determine an effective method for nitrating anilines utilizing silver. After many different experiments, varying different parameters, the conclusion could be drawn that the most effective method for the nitration of anilides uses sodium nitrite in the presence of K2S2O8 (as the oxidant) in acetonitrile at 110°C, with a silver based catalyst (10 mol-% of AgNO2 gave the best yield).

These “building blocks” can go many routes to form different molecules and so the products made are present in a mixture of non-specific equilibria. Although some products will be more present than others due to varying bond stability, there has to be some form of selectivity that can favour the desired reaction from a vast library of precursor reagents.

A vast range of aromatic ketones, with different sizes, positions, and types of functional groups, as well as a variety of alkenes, were investigated. The majority showed high yields and regioselectivity for the Anti-Markovnikov product. It was found that bulkier aromatic ketones generally produced lower yields under the mild reaction conditions, while having the presence of a methyl, methoxy, or a carbon halide group in a para position produced extremely high yields. The C-H alkylation was possible with a huge variety of alkenes, including vinylsilanes, open-chained terminal alkenes, benzene derivatives, and enol ethers.

The synthesis of R2PNa, using sodium metal dispersed through mineral oil (SD), proved to be the most efficient, giving a higher yield than R2PLi and R2PK which produced no substantial yield. The R2PM compounds could be formedand reacted with ArCl in a single pot, R2PNa gave the highest yield (76%) followed by R2PK (43%), R2PLi gave no significant yield.

Thus, it is paramount to maximize the yield and efficiency while minimizing the cost of production of CF3 containing compounds. CF3SO2Cl is a useful reagent for the chlorotrifluoromethylation (addition of a CF3- group) of alkenes, however a costly transition metal complex is employed to catalyze reactions. This report has pioneered an inexpensive catalyst that consists of CuCl2 and pyridine, it catalyzes the chlorotrifluoromethylation of alkenes with CF3SO2Cl. There is a great spectrum of compatible substrate (e.g. aryl alkenes, α,β-unsaturated alkenes and alkyl alkenes) with suitable functional groups that can react to form stable products with high yields at mild conditions.

Catalytic and stoichiometric experiments were used to better understand how [1] successfully carries out these reactions.

Abstract (maximum 150 words): The one pot synthetic pathway that has been reported to form 4-tert-butyl-2,6-dinitrobenzaldehyde is not a viable pathway to synthesizing this compound and preferentially forms the 3,5-dinitroisomer 4-tert-3,5-dinitrobenzaldehyde. This is confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and X ray crystallography analysis of the products of the previously suggested pathway. Increased yields of 4-tert-butyl-2,6-dinitrobenzaldehyde when compared with previously available routes are given when prepared by a newly proposed synthesis pathway (65% yield). This will reliably give the 2,6-dinitro isomer, which is an important synthetic intermediate. The new synthetic route removes the need for chromium reagents and has scalability to allow production of 4-tert-butyl-2,6-dinitrobenzaldehyde in greater quantities. An alternate synthetic route to produce the 3,5-dinitroisomer 4-tert-3,5-dinitrobenzaldehyde is also suggested with reported yields of 95%.",0.7767808437347412,0.6499999761581421

Abstract (maximum 150 words): All-cis-multifluorinated cycloalkanes are known to display very high dipole moments that line up with their aliphatic ring. To form one of these All-cis-multifluorinated cycloalkanes, multiple steps must take place where one diastereoisomer is formed in preference to the other. This report shows a new mechanism, the rhodium-cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC)-catalysed hydrogenation of aromatic compounds that are pre-fluorinated which takes place with hexane. This mechanism means that the reaction no longer has to be a multi-step reaction, but can be a single-step one. This allows for the production of not only multifluorinated cycloalkanes like all-cis-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexafluorocyclohexane, but fluorinated multisubstituted cycloalkanes as well like aliphatic heterocycles.",0.7255451083183289,0.699999988079071

Abstract (149 words):  Controlling the stereo- and chemoselectivity of the semihydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes is very difficult and often requires forcing and harsh reaction conditions or a platinum group metal catalyst. While this is effective, it is unsustainable on industrial levels, creating the need for abundant 3d transition metal catalysts that are effective at milder conditions, such as pre-formed Ni complexes. We focus particularly on the use of the PSiP-supported Ni hydride (iPr-PSiPInd)NiH complex in the formation of (E)-alkenes under 1 atm H2, 25-50C, and 1–2.5 mol % Ni. The use of this catalyst affords an atom-economical catalytic cycle that provides a high (E)-selectivity (E:Z 99:1) and tolerance of a diverse range of functional groups with no over-hydrogenation observed. This is achieved through the formation of alkenyl complex (iPr-PSiPInd)Ni(CPh=CHPh) and its reaction with H2 to afford the (Z)-alkene isomer, which subsequently readily undergoes -hydride elimination to generate the desired (E)-alkene.",0.7088969945907593,0.800000011920929

An improved method for iodo-decarboxylation of aryl carboxylic acids into aryl iodides with efficient catalysis has been detailed, using Cu(OAc)2 for a Cu-catalyzed intermediate in aerobic conditions with a halide source. In this case, an iodine source (NaI) provides an I- ion with the Cu-aryl intermediate to form a aryl-Cu(II)-I complex followed by the formation of the desired aryl-iodide product. A resulting side product, Cu(0) is readily oxidized to Cu(II), closing a catalytic cycle that only functions under aerobic conditions.  Aryl iodides hold great importance across industrial fields, a cheaper, less complex method is highly viable in comparison to the current conventional methods.

This means that all-cis-multifuorinated cycloalkanes have substantial electrostatic character. They have dipole moments perpendicular to the aliphatic ring. The cis selectivity is favoured as hydrogenation of arenes is usually highly cis-selective and it’s obtained by nucleophilic substitution. The hydrogenation of stabilized arenes is dominated by heterogeneous catalysis. A method was obtained for the highly selective hydrogenation of (multi)fluorinated arenes and heteroarenes. To reduce multiple products on this reaction yield, a combination of rhodium with a strongly electron-donating cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) ligand can be used. In this route decomposition pathways were significantly diminished. The impact of this route is a single step method for multisubstitusted and multiflourinated cycloalkanes.

Abstract (maximum 150 words):  Several methods for the synthesis of 4-tert-butyl-2,6-dinitrobenzaldehyde have been reported for their use as precursor-molecules in the preparation of dyes, pigments, and macrocycles. We report that one method yields not the 2,6-isomer but the 3,5-isomer, 4-tert-butyl-3,5-dinitrobenzaldehyde, as confirmed by comparison with an improved, intentional synthesis of the 3,5-isomer. Another reported method of synthesizing the 2,6-isomer, though viable to produce the claimed product, is not suitable for scaling to a large scale due to its low yield and need for chromium reagents and chromatography. Here, we present an improved, scalable method for the synthesis of 4-tert-butyl-2,6-dinitrobenzaldehyde without the need for either chromatography or chromium reagents. Along with this, 1H and 13C NMR spectra as well as the X-ray crystal structures of both the 2,6- and 3,5-isomers are reported.",0.819237470626831,0.699999988079071

Direct hydrogenation of readily available fluoroarenes has been recognized as a convenient one-step alternative with high cis-stereoselectivity, however competing hydrodefluorination has inhibited progress with standard heterogeneous hydrogenation catalysts. We present a hydrogenation procedure utilizing a catalytic cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) rhodium complex in non-polar hexane which was found to greatly favour hydrogenation with high cis-selectivity. This method allows for a wide variety of all-cis-(multi)fluorinated cycloalkanes and heterocycles to be directly synthesised due to the hydrogenation tolerance of many functionalities and are anticipated to be useful building blocks in biologically important compounds, pharmaceuticals and materials.",0.6516454219818115,0.800000011920929

This reaction is remarkable due to the large variety of alkenes that can be used, and the excellent regioselectivity toward the anti-Markovnikov products. Before this reaction was discovered, there was not a low-cost catalyst system, using abundant first row transition metals which could be carried out under mild reaction conditions. However, this reaction uses a relatively simple low-valence iron complex catalyst that is not formed in-situ like most iron catalysed C-H functionalizations. It can be used with or without a solvent at relatively low reaction temperatures, and the linear alkylation products produced have excellent yields. For most iron-catalysed C−H functionalizations, the substrate must be an arene with a nitrogen-containing directing group or a heteroarene, but this is not necessary for this reaction and a much wider scope of substrates can be used.",0.7917206287384033,0.800000011920929

Abstract (maximum 150 words):  Organophosphines (R3P) have a variety of applications in organic synthesis and can be generated via the preparation of R2PNa. R2PNa is selectively prepared by reacting SD (sodium dispersed finely in mineral oil) with phosphinites R2POR’ and chlorophosphines R2PCl as well as with the selective cleavage of C-P bonds in diarylphosphines and triarylphosphines. R2PNa then reacts with ArCl to afford R2PAr.  R2PNa produces higher yields and no coupled products unlike the use of R2PLi and R2PK; it is also more economic due to its abundance and safer to handle. ArCl is used in favour of ArBr and ArI due to generating higher yields. The reaction of ArCl and R2PNa was accelerated by the presence of an electron-withdrawing group on the benzene ring and decelerated by alkyl groups. A variety of  phospines were prepared including unsymmetric phosphines which could be produced in one pot with Ph3P as starting material. (147 words)",0.8858829140663147,0.75

To find an organocatalyst for the enantioselective alpha-fluorination of ketones, a library of both novel and known amine catalysts was analysed. To find the best system, a mathematical formula combining reaction efficiency and enantiocontrol in a high-throughput analysis was used. It was determined that a cinchona-based amine alkaloid was the optimal catalyst for the highly enantioselective alpha-fluorination of complex carbonyl systems, including five- and seven-membered cyclic ketones. Additionally, the amine catalysed reaction showed high levels of regio-, chemo-, enantio-, and diastereoselectivity for a number of ketones and thus provides a valuable mechanism for the creation of fluorine synthons used in chemical synthesis. 2",0.8148513436317444,0.8500000238418579

Abstract: The preparation, application and reaction mechanism of sodium phosphide R2PNa have been studied and compared with other alkali metal phosphides R2PM (M = Li and K) with Na found superior to Li and K. R2PNa could be selectively and accurately prepared at room temperature via reaction of R2PZ (Z = Ar, Cl, OR etc.) with SD (sodium finely dispersed in paraffin oil) and also from triarylphosphines and diarylphosphines via the selective cleavage of C−P bonds. R2PNa was reacted with a variety of ArCl to efficiently produce R2PAr in high yields. ArCl is superior to ArBr and ArI since they only gave low yields of the products. An electron-withdrawing group on the benzene ring of ArCl substantially accelerated the reactions withR2PNa. The application of this method was demonstrated by preparing a wide range of organophosphines from their corresponding chlorides, and chiral phosphines from sodium phosphides and methyl chlorides.

However, all-cis-multifluorinated cycloalkanes are complex to synthesize as they need multistep sequences from diastereoselectively prefunctionalized precursors.

When comparing with the reaction catalysed by TfOH under similar conditions, Fe(OTf)2 was discovered to produce superior yields. A mechanism has been proposed for this reaction where Fe(OTf)2 first activates the aldehyde and then the arylethanol attacks before the closure of the ring. This synthesis uses a cheap catalyst and produces only water as a by-product and so could find use in the pharmaceutical industry as a method of synthesising isochromans.Number of times cited:2{Data taken from Web of Science on (04/02/2021)",0.6899279952049255,0.699999988079071

This study explores the characteristics and differences between volatile and nonvolatile compounds in rice fermented by 12 different types of lactic acid bacteria. Volatile samples were analysed using gas chromatography with solid-phase microextraction and nonvolatile compounds involved gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Compounds were found to be significantly different depending on the lactic acid bacteria used. Volatile molecules included esters, benzene and its derivatives, and nonvolatile molecules included amino acids and carbohydrates. In analysis, PCA plots were used on the samples which indicated that they could be discovered by different microbial strains. The advances revealed that by differing the LAB strains, the properties of the fermented rice changed over each molecule depending on which microbial strains were present, aiding further improvements in the quality and condition of fermented rice produce.",0.791574239730835,0.699999988079071

This paper presents one such method and conclusively proves that superior results can be obtained through the use of Cinchona alkaloid catalysts in producing α-ﬂuoroketones, incredibly useful medical agents due to their C-F stereocenters. The usage of this primary amine organocatalyst with electrophilic ﬂuorine reagents enabled impressive regio-, chemo-, enantio- and diastereoselectivity for a range of carboxylic and heterocyclic ketone substrates. This method prioritized enantiocontrol over yield, meaning that post-formation racemization was successfully avoided.

This was determined experimentally through synthesis of a group of isochromans using various different catalysts being compared to isochromans synthesized using Fe(OTf)(2) catalyst, which were also further tested under varying experimental conditions involving temperature and atmosphere.  Through use of Fe(OTf)(2) up to 99% yield is achieved for the reaction of 1% (mol) Fe(OTf)(2) at 70 °C. Moreover in a nitrogen atmosphere, the time efficiency of the reaction is concluded experimentally as under 4 hours. In addition, the use of this iron catalyst generates high atom economy and cost effectiveness. Effective synthesis of isochromans has potential benefits in pharmaceutical chemistry and with the only by product to the reaction being the formation of water, the iron catalyst mitigates environmental harm.",0.7024929523468018,0.6499999761581421

N-ethylation and N-methylation of a broad range of aliphatic and aromatic compounds were demonstrated using a (cyclopentadienone) iron tricarbonyl complex under basic conditions. These compounds were ethylated or methylated using ethanol or methanol. The use of methanol was more energetically demanding due to its higher enthalpy of dehydrogenation. Consequently, a change in hydrogen pressure was required for selective dehydration over dehydrogenation to methylate some compounds. The method shown produced mono- or di- alkylated compounds in high yields. DFT calculations revealed potential pathways for the reaction and highlighted the role of hydrogen pressure in driving the equilibrium towards one intermediate and hence the reduction of imines.",0.7351016998291016,0.6000000238418579

In this article the use of bis(phosphino)silyl Ni hybride complex ((PSiP)-Ni) in catalyzing the reactions of diaryl and SiMe3-protected terminal alkynes to (E)-alkenes is reported. (PSiP)-Ni was found to efficiently catalyze (E)-selective semihydrogenation of alkynes under very mild conditions with H2. Stoichiometric experiments showed the high selectivity of (PSiP)-Ni is due to the alkyne inserting into the complex and isomerization of the alkene being facile processes.

Abstract: Compounds containing N-methylated and ethylated amines are effective in crossing the blood-brain barrier in the human body, making methods of adding this functionality useful in the development of drugs which target the brain and CNS. However, conventional synthesis methods have typically employed the use of toxic reagents such as formaldehyde or expensive rare earth metal-based catalysts containing phosphine ligands, making safer and more sustainable methods sought after. The paper reports on a method for the addition of methyl and ethyl groups to amines under mildly basic conditions, utilizing a catalyst made from earth-abundant iron. The mechanism for the reaction occurs through a ‘hydrogen auto-transfer’ process, wherein the catalyst deprotonates the alcohol, which undergoes a condensation reaction with the target amine, producing an imine. The catalyst transfers the hydrogen to the formed imine, minimizing side-product formation caused by self-condensation, producing methylated and ethylated amines in high yields.",0.7534485459327698,0.8500000238418579
