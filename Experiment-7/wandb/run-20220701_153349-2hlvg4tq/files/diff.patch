M.; Stuart, M. C. A.; Peyralans, J. J.-P.; Otto, S. Science 2010, 327, 1502‚Äì1506.  Abstract (maximum 150 words):  Replication is essential for the origin of life, but how it emerged is still a mystery. It is known that molecules can self-replicate by kinetically controlled autocatalysis; however, these systems are very simple compared to organisms with complex internal organization, so what factors move replication forward the most is under investigation. By using a small dynamic combinatorial library, two self-replicating peptide-derived macrocycles are reported. It is found that macrocycles are capable of promoting their own formation, while forming extended assemblies held together with ùõΩ-sheet type structures. Furthermore, the mode of agitation (shaking and stirring) influences which replicator dominates. These findings imply that mechanical forces can determine which products are formed when there are multiple replicators available and how far a covalent synthesis goes.",0.7332108616828918,0.75

Abstract (maximum 150 words):   Sulfur compounds containing a tetrahydrothiophene ring system as a core structure have therapeutic applications, hence the demand for new tetrahydrothiophene derivatives is constantly growing at the biological, pharmacological, and medicinal chemistry level. The presence of a trifluoromethyl group is an example of this since it can cause changes in the physico-chemical properties of a molecule. However, not much could be found in the literature. For that reason, the aim of this study was to synthesize trifluoromethyl tetrahydrothiophene derivatives substituted with heteroatomic functional group. The approach for the synthesis consisted of using a [3+2]-cycloaddition reaction of a 1-functionalized 3,3,3-trifluoropropene derivative as dipolarophile with various 1,3 dipoles and thiocarbonyl ylide generated in situ from elimination of chloromethyl trimethylsilylmethyl sulfide. The findings of this study show the formation of a new 4-(trifluoromethyl)tetrahydrothiophenes with ester, sulfone, sulfoximine, sulfonamide, and phospohonate moiety. This was supported via the use of NMR, mass-spectrometry, melting points, and chromatography.",0.8393197655677795,0.699999988079071

Abstract (maximum 150 words):  This paper outlines a novel approach to the synthesis of nitrated anilides via a regioselective silver-catalysed pathway. Ortho-selective C-H functionalization was achieved using sodium nitrate as a nitrating agent in the presence of K2S2O8 which achieved good yields with both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituents. The proposed mechanism starts with the initial formation of an arylsilver complex and proceeds through radical intermediates to produce the ortho-nitrated products. The nitration of aromatic sulphonamides via this mechanism was also successfully demonstrated. Ortho-nitrated anilides are difficult to access through traditional approaches and this procedure provides an efficient way to synthesis this critical organic precursor for the pharmaceutical and dye industry.",0.6426430344581604,0.8500000238418579

Methylation occurred on many of the aryl and aliphatic amines at high yields, with some undergoing dimethylation.

Abstract (maximum 150 words):   A range of superior reactants and preparation procedures have been studied in association with the synthesis of high yield organophosphines from metal phosphides and aryl halides. Mechanistic pathways have been given following the reductive cleavage of R3P with sodium to produce R2PNa, which further underwent substitution with ArCl to generate R2PAr product. No catalyst was required. Sodium phosphide R2PNa can be prepared with reliable selectivity via C-P bond cleavage of di and triarylphosphines, as well as from reactions with phosphinites and chlorophosphines. R2PNa synthesis was most successful on comparison with other alkali metal substitutes, Li and K. ArCl reacted most efficiently with Ph2PNa when compared to other aryl halides, PhI and PhBr, in which low yields were retrieved.

Catal. 2022, 12, 146-155  Abstract (maximum 150 words): The selective semihydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes is difficult to achieve due to the competitive formation of both (E)- and (Z)- alkene isomers and overreduction to form alkanes. Processes describing the direct formation of (E)-alkenes are limited and so the identification of an abundant transition metal catalyst for their direct hydrogenation using molecular H2 would represent a valuable advance.  In this study we investigated whether bis(phosphino)silyl Ni hydride complex (iPr-PSiPInd)NiH, designated as Complex 1, could act as this suitable catalyst. We tested complex 1 against a wide range of diaryl alkynes, SiMe3-protected alkynes and internal alkynes; all of these were found to be reactive except internal alkynes with ketone or ester substitution.

Abstract (maximum 150 words):  Mechanisms involving either the release or cleavage of hydrogen in basic conditions involving iron, cyclopentadienone and amines are described. Reasoning for these new techniques in N-ethylation and N-methylation of amines is to resolve the issues of previous methods, which give low yields and are toxic. The primary goal of the work undertaken focuses on the iron catalyst, key for the reaction to proceed, and ultimately optimizing the Fe1 (2 mol %).

Abstract: Compounds containing N-methylated and ethylated amines are effective in crossing the blood-brain barrier in the human body, making methods of adding this functionality useful in the development of drugs which target the brain and CNS. However, conventional synthesis methods have typically employed the use of toxic reagents such as formaldehyde or expensive rare earth metal-based catalysts containing phosphine ligands, making safer and more sustainable methods sought after. The paper reports on a method for the addition of methyl and ethyl groups to amines under mildly basic conditions, utilizing a catalyst made from earth-abundant iron. The mechanism for the reaction occurs through a ‚Äòhydrogen auto-transfer‚Äô process, wherein the catalyst deprotonates the alcohol, which undergoes a condensation reaction with the target amine, producing an imine. The catalyst transfers the hydrogen to the formed imine, minimizing side-product formation caused by self-condensation, producing methylated and ethylated amines in high yields.",0.7895854115486145,0.8500000238418579

Because of this, an investigation was performed to determine an effective method for nitrating anilines utilizing silver. After many different experiments, varying different parameters, the conclusion could be drawn that the most effective method for the nitration of anilides uses sodium nitrite in the presence of K2S2O8 (as the oxidant) in acetonitrile at 110¬∞C, with a silver based catalyst (10 mol-% of AgNO2 gave the best yield).

However, it is unclear where it originated as it does not follow a thermodynamic path towards equilibrium. To investigate its possible emergence, a dynamic combinatorial library was set up using dithiol and alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic Œ±-amino acid building blocks, leucine, and lysine respectively. The mixture was observed under pH 8 and agitation, both stirring and shaking. It was shown through characterization that there was significant formation of macro √ü-sheet structures, with agitation increasing their amount. From this a schematic model of self-organisation was proposed with two main processes: elongation of fibres; and breakage of them, which exponentially increased the amount. Differences in formation of heptamer versus hexamer show formation being kinetically determined in the fibre growing phase. These findings support the notion that kinetic products can result from reversible processes if non-covalent interactions are dominant enough.",0.7310948967933655,0.6499999761581421

This creates a problem as the 2,6-dinitro isomer is a lot more useful in chemistry and is used to prepare a number of dyes, pigments and other macromolecules.

The single-crystal X-ray structures are also described, as this step was responsible for realising that the compound 4-tert-butyl-3,5-dinitrobenzaldehyde had been misidentified as 4-tert-butyl-2,6-dinitrobenzaldehyde.",0.6472219824790955,0.75

Which leads to a large dipole moment, ideal for many polar reactions in material chemistry. Therefore, a greater polarity from cis-fluoro-arenes is highly applicable and valued and optimized synthesis reactions are intriguing. Previously, production of cis-fluoro-arenes have given low yields, required large quantities of catalysts and resulted in unwanted diastereoisomers. A new proposed method of synthesis is hydrogenation, which can be applied to a large variety of reagents, uses minimal catalysts, 0.5 - 1%, and gives high yields of the products. This method gives access to highly polar compounds and considers diastereoselectivity in a single step as well as ensuring hydrodefluorination does not occur.",0.7261931300163269,0.6000000238418579

However, it is unclear where it originated as it does not follow a thermodynamic path towards equilibrium. To investigate its possible emergence, a dynamic combinatorial library was set up using dithiol and alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic Œ±-amino acid building blocks, leucine, and lysine respectively. The mixture was observed under pH 8 and agitation, both stirring and shaking. It was shown through characterization that there was significant formation of macro √ü-sheet structures, with agitation increasing their amount. From this a schematic model of self-organisation was proposed with two main processes: elongation of fibres; and breakage of them, which exponentially increased the amount. Differences in formation of heptamer versus hexamer show formation being kinetically determined in the fibre growing phase. These findings support the notion that kinetic products can result from reversible processes if non-covalent interactions are dominant enough.",0.7134547233581543,0.6499999761581421

In living organisms, the replication process is not in equilibrium, resulting in uneven distributions of molecules. This unequal equilibrium could be the consequence of a whole range of factors, some impacting the equilibrium more significantly than others. With the use of small dynamic combinatorial libraries an investigation was carried out on two self-replicating macrocycles derived from peptides, competing for raw materials. The replication is driven by formation of fibers, made up of macrocycle monomers and stabilized with ÔÅ¢-sheets, promoting further formation. Mechanosensitivity, whether the sample is stirred or shaken influences which macrocycle is the more dominant one. These findings suggest the outcome of covalent synthesis reactions can be determined by mechanical forces selecting for one replicator over another.",0.7271831035614014,0.6499999761581421

An alternative method of N-methylation of amines has been developed to mitigate these problems. Through use of a hydrogen borrowing strategy a more efficient way of N-methylation presents itself. The general reaction involves an oxidation of methanol with a metal, forming a ketone, and the hydrogen which has been removed is bound to the metal in a borrowing like manner; the hydrogen is given back to the new imine which is formed from reductive amination of the ketone. Compounds can be altered from being O-methylated to N-methylated through this strategy with minimal use of hazardous materials or problems with regioselectivity.",0.7559029459953308,0.6000000238418579

This procedure tolerates the use of varying electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups on N-protected indoles and iodoarenes. However, electron-withdrawing groups present on N-protected indoles tend to react slower than the unprotected indoles and relatively do not yield as much. This protocol also exhibits the use of deactivated indole rings without any significant issues and tolerance to the presence of other halogen atoms.

This is owed to the strong dipole moment and electronic properties that characterize said bond. Synthesizing fluorinated cycloalkanes holds high specificity, a consequence of cis alignment, creating complex multistep synthetic sequences and a requirement for well-established precursors. Wiesenfeldt et als hydrogenation of (multi)fluorinated arenes and heteroarenes through the use of rhodium and cyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) offers a simplified one-step protocol to the desired product. The synthetic strategy adds hydrogen in the preferential cis positions to yield a variety of (multi)fluorinated cycloalkenes, hetero-substituted (multi)fluorinated products, which include all-cis-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexafluoroclyohexane, alongside newfound analogs. Products as such, hold the capacity for further functionalization and retain properties of value in the pharmaceutical, agrochemical and medical fields. The susceptibility of the product identity to varying reaction conditions allows specific product isolation, a true benefit of the protocol.",0.8094078898429871,0.6499999761581421

Journal of Sulfur Chemistry. 2019, 40, 629-640.                Abstract (147 words):  The presence of a tetrahydrothiophene ring system, in heterocyclic molecules containing sulphur, influences the biological and physio-chemistry of the molecule which can be exploited for medicinal applications.  Publication regarding the properties and derivation of trifluoromethyl tetrahydrothiophene compounds substituted with heteroatomic functional groups are limited in number and the synthesis routes described are often inaccessible.  Thus this paper describes the synthesis of 3-functional 4-trifluoromethyl-tetrahydrothiophenes, which is initiated by producing thiocarbonyl ylide from the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of electron-deficient alkenes; this occurs in situ by elimination of chloromethyl trimethylsilylmethyl sulphide (which is prepared from trimethylsilylmethanethiol, 1,3,5-trioxane and gaseous hydrochloric acid ) and the reaction proceeds under reflux in the presence of acetonitrile,  1.5-fold excess sulphide and 2-fold excess caesium fluoride.  The approach has good yields of 3-functional 4-trifluoromethyl-tetrahydrothiophenes which are composed of only the trans stereoisomer. Thus, the paper bring advancement to the understanding to the derivation of 3-functional 4-trifluoromethyl-tetrahydrothiophenes.

Traditional methods use concentrated sulfuric and nitric acids, where reaction conditions are harsh and have low tolerance for other functional groups. They were replaced by using nitrate salt reagents, which can be difficult to prepare and, from the resultant metal oxides, have a low atom economy. More recent methods use AgNO2 to selectively nitrate arenes, but this method uses high quantities of rare metals, which is unsustainable.  This reaction uses NaNO2 and K2S2O8 in CH3CN, using catalytic AgNO2, to selectively nitrate the ortho positions on a variety of arenes, displaying high regioselectivity and chemoselectivity as well as moderate to high yields with a selection of substitutions on the starting anilide.

Abstract (maximum 150 words):  A direct method has been reported for the first time for the stereoselective synthesis of multi-substituted cyclobutanes. Unlike previously used synthesis methods such as [2+2] cycloaddition, radical cyclisation, and ring contraction extrusion, this allows for the novel product of cyclobutanes with heterocyclic substituents. A possible mechanism has been proposed for this synthesis involving an initial reaction between the pyrrolidine and iodonitrene species to form a 1,1-diazene. Subsequent elimination of N2, mediated by nitrogen extrusion to generate a 1,4-biradical product which undergoes rapid cyclisation yielding the cyclobutene product is suggested. The viability of this method is proven through the formal synthesis of piperabronine B outlined in this paper. Beyond this, optimum temperature conditions are explored in optimizing the solubility of the starting material and intermediates. Despite these optimized conditions, yield varies from low to good, ranging from 24-42% for pyrrolidines with ‚ç∫-heteroarene substituents, and 42-88% for pyrrolidines with ‚ç∫-aryl substituents.    149 words",0.7581042051315308,0.6499999761581421

The nitrogen extrusion process exploits the reactivity of N-I and stability of N2, forming a radical on both Œ± carbons previously bonded to the nitrogen in the pyrrolidine when in the presence of Idosobenzene acetate. The radicals can then react together forming a new C-C bond and consequently a cyclobutane ring. This process proved to be a successful high yield stereoselective synthesis of many unsymmetrical spirocyclic cyclobutanes and a successful synthesis of piperarborenine B, a natural product. The products contained alkene impurities from another potential mechanism where the bond between the Íûµ-carbons breaks resulting in Íûµ-fragments which then react with the Œ± carbon radicals forming two alkene products.",0.7293802499771118,0.6499999761581421

This study focuses on the difference in volatile and non-volatile compounds formed by 12 different forms of lactic acid bacteria when fermenting rice. The study found that a total of 47 volatile and 37 non-volatile compounds were formed. The identities of volatile compounds were determined by extracting samples via solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) and analysing them via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The identities of non-volatile compounds were identified by extracting samples via derivatization and then analysing them via gas chromatography-time-of-flight/mass spectrometry. Our findings indicate that the composition of the products differ significantly change across different strains of lactic acid bacteria. These finding could be used to improve the quality of rice-based fermented products such as probiotic beverages for significant health benefits.",0.6584117412567139,0.699999988079071

This protocol also gives direct access to a range of all-cis-fluorinated cycloalkane derivatives and multisubstituted all-cis-heterocycles with high diastereoselectivity.

Abstract:  200014937 Isochromans are heterocyclic compounds utilised in pharmaceuticals for therapeutic applications, such as proton therapy. Numerous synthetic routes based on the oxa-Pictet-Spengler reaction have been established to produce substituted isochromans. However, these require costly conditions to synthesise a low-yield whilst forming toxic side products. The aim is to determine a more cost-effective method to produce a high yield of isochromans without damaging the environment. Here we show that the iron catalyst, Fe(OTf)2, gives the highest yield of product at a low concentration of 1 mol% compared to more toxic Br√∏nsted and Lewis acids. Fe(OTf)2 produces isochromans and the side product of water, so is environmentally benign. The reaction involves a relatively low temperature of 70¬∫C and reaction period of 4 hours with the Fe(OTf)2 and toluene solvent to give a high yield of 99%. These economic conditions and environmentally-friendly reaction provides a more accessible way to produce isochromans for pharmaceutical compounds.",0.7370719909667969,0.8999999761581421

Various iodionitrene compounds were used for comparison in order to derive a possible mechanism for the reaction. The formation of a 1,4-biradical intermediate allows for the C-C bond of the cyclobutane product to be formed sterospecifically . This intermediate is generated through the 1,1-diazene intermediate from the electrophilic amination of pyrrolidine with  a iodonitrene compound in situ.

Abstract (maximum 150 words):  Stereoselective semi-hydrogenation of alkynes to (E)-alkenes is important for chemical synthesis. This is challenging due to competition between the formation of E and Z -isomers and the risk of over hydrogenation, resulting in the formation of alkanes. Previously, examples of platinum group metal-mediated catalyst have been found to selectively catalyze semi-hydrogenation of alkynes to (E)-alkenes however, a more abundant 3d metal-based alternative with a higher atom economy is highly sought after. This study found that the bis(phosphino)silyl Ni complex (iPr-PSiPInd)NiH was able to E-selectively catalyze the semi-hydrogenation of a range of substituted diaryl alkynes and SiMe3-protected terminal alkynes under mild conditions with relatively high functional group tolerance. This was achieved via a tandem reaction during which the alkyne was first semi-hydrogenated to a (Z)-alkene then subsequently isomerized to the (E)-alkene.

Cyclic self-replicating peptides, a hexamer and heptamer, were investigated under differing mechanical agitations ‚Äì no agitation, stirring and shaking ‚Äì in the presence of the thermodynamic trimer and tetramer mixture. The hexamer and heptamer were shown to be formed of fibres in a b-sheet formation, which was crucial to self-replication and resulted in mechanosensitivity: the fibre structure prevented re-equilibration to other macrocyclic structures. Hexamer dominated under shaking whilst heptamer dominated under stirring due to differences in efficiency of fibre fragmentation, influencing exponential growth.

Abstract (maximum 150 words): The electronic properties of cis-multifluorinated cycloalkanes, particularly the highly polarised and highly desired C-F bond, mean such compounds are sought after by the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and material science industries. A synthetic route is discussed via the catalytic hydrogenation of fluoroarenes to the advantageous cis-(multi)fluorinated cycloalkanes. Herein, a highly selective pathway for the hydrogenation of a broad scope of (multi)fluorinated arenes and heteroarenes, hence offering access to cis-diastereoselectively (multi)fluorinated building blocks, highly polar all-cis-(multi)fluorocycloalkanes, and fluorinated aliphatic heterocycles is described. We used preliminary mechanistic experiments to investigate the observed increase in selectivity for the hydrogenated product versus the hydrofluorinated side product by changing the polarity of the solvent; for example, the selectivity using a polar solvent such as methanol (1:9) was compared to that of the less polar solvent dichloromethane (5:1).

N-ethylation of twelve different anilines with ethanol, caesium hydroxide and the Iron catalyst resulted in high yields, while N-methylation of primary and secondary amines with methanol under ten Atmospheres of Hydrogen gas resulted in high yields as well. DFT analysis also shows that Hydrogen displays some importance in the thermodynamic equilibrium of methylation and ethylation of amines as well as being a reducing agent.",0.6679189205169678,0.6499999761581421

When completing the analysis of the product it was found to have the expected 1H and 13C spectra of 4-tert-butyl-2,6-dinitrobenzaldehyde. However, once evaporated out, the single-crystal x-ray diffraction highlighted that the product was in fact its isomer, 4-tert-butyl-3,5-dinitrobenzaldyhyde.

Traditional C-P bond-forming techniques have limited applications due to harsh reaction conditions and toxic reagents.  Functionalized pyrrolines are valuable structural motifs in bioactive molecules, their synthesis can be used to construct C-P bonds. They can be obtained via cascade cyclization of Œ≥,Œ¥-unsaturated oxime esters under transition-metal (TM) catalysis and although the field of TM-catalyzed imino-functionalization of alkenes is developed, the imino-phosphorylation process has not been studied. Several reaction conditions were screened, it was found that a silver salt was essential for the transformation. Leaving groups and reaction temperature were also found to affect the yield. The first silver-promoted imino-phosphorylation of Œ≥,Œ¥-unsaturated oxime esters via cascade cyclization was developed. It allows for efficient, oxidant-free construction of phosphine-containing pyrrolines. This reaction can also achieve bulky trivalent phosphine ligands which are difficult to synthesize using other methods.",0.8392160534858704,0.800000011920929

This radical pathway has a greater substrate scope, is metal and photocatalyst free and proceeds via a visible-light-induced process aided by a ternary electron-donor complex, that is formed by 2H-indazoles, arial diazonium salts and pyridine.

Abstract (maximum 150 words):  The synthesis of (E)-alkenes from alkynes via selective semihydrogenation is a regularly used process in both small-scale synthesis and industrial processes. Processes such as Birch-type reduction are currently in use for this synthesis but exhibited complications such as: harsh reaction conditions, limited range of functional group tolerance and requiring a multistep process. Research into developing a mechanism capable of eliminate such issues lead to the discovery of the bis(phosphino)silyl Ni hydride complex (iPr-PSiPInd)NiH [1] as a pre-catalyst for such a reaction. Catalytic and stoichiometric experiments were used to better understand how [1] successfully carries out these reactions. [1] is shown to be involved during the hydrogenation and isomerization steps of the reaction. [1] can accommodate the selective semi-hydrogenation of range of diaryl alkynes, SiMe3-protected terminal alkynes and a diverse range of functional groups under mild reaction conditions (1 atm ùêª!, 25-50 ‚ÑÉ, and 1-2.5 mol % Ni).",0.6921811103820801,0.800000011920929

Abstract (maximum 150 words): Cyclobutane is an important structural feature of some bioactive natural products with limited numbers of effective synthetic pathways. This study aims to introduce an applicable synthetic method of multisubstituted cyclobutane via the electrophilic amination of pyrrolidines with hypervalent iodine(III) compounds. Experiments include 1). Examining a variety of hypervalent iodine reagents, nitrogen sources and solvents while keeping a single pyrrolidine as a model substrate 2). Investigating a range of substituted pyrrolidines, including spirocyclic pyrrolidines 3). Examining the stereoselective transformations of several optical pure spirooxindoles 4). Analysing trapped radicals for a pyrrolidine ring contraction 5). Total synthesis of piperarborenine B was conducted. Results showed the mechanism involved simultaneous breaking of C-N bonds, formation of 1,4-biradical intermediate and rapid formation of C-C bonds.

It was previously thought that enantioselective Œ±-fluorination could only be done with aldehydes but not ketones. This paper proves that this is not the case.  A high through put library of catalysts was generated which determined that a primary amine organocatalyst was required for this reaction. The highly enantioselective Œ±-fluorination of a ketone was shown to also require an electrophilic fluorine reagent such as NFSI. This reaction mechanism proved to have a high yield for 5, 6 and 7 membered ring ketones as well as more complex cyclic ketones.

Increased yields of 4-tert-butyl-2,6-dinitrobenzaldehyde when compared with previously available routes are given when prepared by a newly proposed synthesis pathway (65% yield).

To form one of these All-cis-multifluorinated cycloalkanes, multiple steps must take place where one diastereoisomer is formed in preference to the other. This report shows a new mechanism, the rhodium-cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC)-catalysed hydrogenation of aromatic compounds that are pre-fluorinated which takes place with hexane. This mechanism means that the reaction no longer has to be a multi-step reaction, but can be a single-step one. This allows for the production of not only multifluorinated cycloalkanes like all-cis-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexafluorocyclohexane, but fluorinated multisubstituted cycloalkanes as well like aliphatic heterocycles.",0.7255451083183289,0.699999988079071

Abstract (149 words):  Controlling the stereo- and chemoselectivity of the semihydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes is very difficult and often requires forcing and harsh reaction conditions or a platinum group metal catalyst. While this is effective, it is unsustainable on industrial levels, creating the need for abundant 3d transition metal catalysts that are effective at milder conditions, such as pre-formed Ni complexes. We focus particularly on the use of the PSiP-supported Ni hydride (iPr-PSiPInd)NiH complex in the formation of (E)-alkenes under 1 atm H2, 25-50ÔÇ∞C, and 1‚Äì2.5 mol % Ni. The use of this catalyst affords an atom-economical catalytic cycle that provides a high (E)-selectivity (E:Z 99:1) and tolerance of a diverse range of functional groups with no over-hydrogenation observed. This is achieved through the formation of alkenyl complex (iPr-PSiPInd)Ni(CPh=CHPh) and its reaction with H2 to afford the (Z)-alkene isomer, which subsequently readily undergoes ÔÅ¢-hydride elimination to generate the desired (E)-alkene.",0.7088969945907593,0.800000011920929

An improved method for iodo-decarboxylation of aryl carboxylic acids into aryl iodides with efficient catalysis has been detailed, using Cu(OAc)2 for a Cu-catalyzed intermediate in aerobic conditions with a halide source. In this case, an iodine source (NaI) provides an I- ion with the Cu-aryl intermediate to form a aryl-Cu(II)-I complex followed by the formation of the desired aryl-iodide product. A resulting side product, Cu(0) is readily oxidized to Cu(II), closing a catalytic cycle that only functions under aerobic conditions.

This means that all-cis-multifuorinated cycloalkanes have substantial electrostatic character. They have dipole moments perpendicular to the aliphatic ring. The cis selectivity is favoured as hydrogenation of arenes is usually highly cis-selective and it‚Äôs obtained by nucleophilic substitution. The hydrogenation of stabilized arenes is dominated by heterogeneous catalysis. A method was obtained for the highly selective hydrogenation of (multi)fluorinated arenes and heteroarenes. To reduce multiple products on this reaction yield, a combination of rhodium with a strongly electron-donating cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) ligand can be used. In this route decomposition pathways were significantly diminished. The impact of this route is a single step method for multisubstitusted and multiflourinated cycloalkanes.

A convenient way to synthesise stable derivatives, which were characterised by 1H, 13C, 19F NMR spectra, mass spectroscopy and elementary analysis data, is an elimination ‚Äì addition pathway using chloromethyl trimethylsilyl methyl sulphide as the starting material, proceeding with a cycloaddition of electron-deficient alkenes to thiocarbonyl yield in situ  and under reflux conditions with excess sulphide and CsF.  The synthesis of new 4- (trifluoromethyl)tetrahydrothiophenyl-S-oxides, S-imino-S-oxides and S,S-dioxides was successful and well documented.",0.8209846615791321,0.699999988079071

The iron-catalyzed reaction between Œ≤-arylethanol and a carbonyl compound via intramolecular electrophilic aromatic substitution has shown a significant increase in the yield of the isolated isochroman product.

Abstract: The preparation, application and reaction mechanism of sodium phosphide R2PNa have been studied and compared with other alkali metal phosphides R2PM (M = Li and K) with Na found superior to Li and K. R2PNa could be selectively and accurately prepared at room temperature via reaction of R2PZ (Z = Ar, Cl, OR etc.) with SD (sodium finely dispersed in paraffin oil) and also from triarylphosphines and diarylphosphines via the selective cleavage of C‚àíP bonds. R2PNa was reacted with a variety of ArCl to efficiently produce R2PAr in high yields. ArCl is superior to ArBr and ArI since they only gave low yields of the products. An electron-withdrawing group on the benzene ring of ArCl substantially accelerated the reactions withR2PNa. The application of this method was demonstrated by preparing a wide range of organophosphines from their corresponding chlorides, and chiral phosphines from sodium phosphides and methyl chlorides. Unsymmetrical phosphines could also be conveniently generated in one pot synthetic procedure from Ph3P. Possible echanisms were given for the reductive cleavage of R3P by sodium to R2PNa and the following reactions of R2PNa with ArCl generating R2PAr.",0.9104808568954468,0.0

Traditional methods of N-methylation involve Eschweiller-Clarke type reactions, the use of methylating agents such as iodomethane, palladium-form-aldehyde reductive amination or reduction of carbamates. These methods use toxic compounds and have low selectivity. We sought to develop the use of an Earth abundant metal catalyst for use in N-methylation. An Fe(0) complex worked well in N-ethylation of amines and in N-methylation of aromatic amines under basic conditions. In the presence of H2 gas, the complex was found to work in the N-methylation of aliphatic amines. Not only is the use of this complex more environmentally friendly than traditional methods, but it also preserves other functional groups. Computational methods were used to propose the mechanism for the Fe(0) complex catalyzed methylation of amines which highlighted the role of hydrogen pressure and the base in the reaction.",0.7763630151748657,0.8500000238418579

This property is used in both pharmaceutical and agrochemical science to for example tweak polarity. If the C-F bond‚Äôs orientations are further controlled to be on the same face they can be used to design high polar complexes, such as all-cis-multifluorinated cycloalkanes, that can be applied to other scientific areas like material sciences.

Abstract: Compounds containing N-methylated and ethylated amines are effective in crossing the blood-brain barrier in the human body, making methods of adding this functionality useful in the development of drugs which target the brain and CNS. However, conventional synthesis methods have typically employed the use of toxic reagents such as formaldehyde or expensive rare earth metal-based catalysts containing phosphine ligands, making safer and more sustainable methods sought after. The paper reports on a method for the addition of methyl and ethyl groups to amines under mildly basic conditions, utilizing a catalyst made from earth-abundant iron. The mechanism for the reaction occurs through a ‚Äòhydrogen auto-transfer‚Äô process, wherein the catalyst deprotonates the alcohol, which undergoes a condensation reaction with the target amine, producing an imine. The catalyst transfers the hydrogen to the formed imine, minimizing side-product formation caused by self-condensation, producing methylated and ethylated amines in high yields.",0.7534485459327698,0.8500000238418579

Abstract (maximum 150 words):   The organoleptic quality of the rice grains can be increased through the alteration of its tastes and aroma achieved by the fermentation of it using lactic acid bacteria (LAB). Previous studies have reported that this fermentation process can produce volatile and nonvolatile compounds. In this study, the volatile compounds are analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and solid-phase microextraction, and the nonvolatile compounds are determined using gas chromatography-time-of-flight/mass spectrometry after derivatization. 47 volatile compounds were identified, including acids, aldehydes, esters, furan derivatives, ketones, alcohols, benzene and benzene derivatives, hydrocarbons, and terpenes. Also 37 nonvolatile compounds were identified to be amino acids, organic acids, and carbohydrates. A significant difference between the profile of  volatile and nonvolatile compounds produced by obligatorily homofermentative/facultatively heterofermentative LAB and obligatorily heterofermentative LAB is observed.

Abstract (maximum 150 words):  Routes for direct, selective C-H transformations in organic compounds using readily available and abundant chemicals are essential in organic synthesis. First row transition metal catalysts have been employed for C-H functionalizations in non-aromatic compounds. However, a simple earth-abundant base metal catalyst system has yet to be developed for aromatic compounds, especially for atom-deficient C-H additions to multiple bonds. Fe(PMe3)4 proved an effective catalyst for the anti-Markovnikov addition of ortho C-H bonds in aromatic ketones to alkenes. A wide range of alkenes with varying additional functional groups can be used with this catalyst under mild conditions to produce high yields of the corresponding product. A deuterium exchange reaction also proved the C-H bond cleavage to not be the rate limiting step. The developed catalyst is earth-abundant and extensively useful for a range of reactions, therefore applications range across a number of industries.

However, it is unclear where it originated as it does not follow a thermodynamic path towards equilibrium. To investigate its possible emergence, a dynamic combinatorial library was set up using dithiol and alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic Œ±-amino acid building blocks, leucine, and lysine respectively. The mixture was observed under pH 8 and agitation, both stirring and shaking. It was shown through characterization that there was significant formation of macro √ü-sheet structures, with agitation increasing their amount. From this a schematic model of self-organisation was proposed with two main processes: elongation of fibres; and breakage of them, which exponentially increased the amount. Differences in formation of heptamer versus hexamer show formation being kinetically determined in the fibre growing phase. These findings support the notion that kinetic products can result from reversible processes if non-covalent interactions are dominant enough.",0.7230689525604248,0.6499999761581421

N-ethylation and N-methylation of a broad range of aliphatic and aromatic compounds were demonstrated using a (cyclopentadienone) iron tricarbonyl complex under basic conditions. These compounds were ethylated or methylated using ethanol or methanol. The use of methanol was more energetically demanding due to its higher enthalpy of dehydrogenation. Consequently, a change in hydrogen pressure was required for selective dehydration over dehydrogenation to methylate some compounds. The method shown produced mono- or di- alkylated compounds in high yields. DFT calculations revealed potential pathways for the reaction and highlighted the role of hydrogen pressure in driving the equilibrium towards one intermediate and hence the reduction of imines.",0.7941891551017761,0.6000000238418579

Abstract (maximum 150 words): (143 words)   Trifluoromethyl (CF3) is a vital functional group within agrochemistry and medicinal chemistry, this group has allowed the development of life-saving drugs such as Acifluorfen, Efavirenz, Fluoxetine and Pleconaril. Thus, it is paramount to maximize the yield and efficiency while minimizing the cost of production of CF3 containing compounds. CF3SO2Cl is a useful reagent for the chlorotrifluoromethylation (addition of a CF3- group) of alkenes, however a costly transition metal complex is employed to catalyze reactions. This report has pioneered an inexpensive catalyst that consists of CuCl2 and pyridine, it catalyzes the chlorotrifluoromethylation of alkenes with CF3SO2Cl. There is a great spectrum of compatible substrate (e.g. aryl alkenes, Œ±,Œ≤-unsaturated alkenes and alkyl alkenes) with suitable functional groups that can react to form stable products with high yields at mild conditions. Future studies should build upon the usability of the Cu/CF3SO2Cl system in other trifluoromethylation chemistry.",0.5049543380737305,0.800000011920929

A vast range of aromatic ketones, with different sizes, positions, and types of functional groups, as well as a variety of alkenes, were investigated. The majority showed high yields and regioselectivity for the Anti-Markovnikov product. It was found that bulkier aromatic ketones generally produced lower yields under the mild reaction conditions, while having the presence of a methyl, methoxy, or a carbon halide group in a para position produced extremely high yields. The C-H alkylation was possible with a huge variety of alkenes, including vinylsilanes, open-chained terminal alkenes, benzene derivatives, and enol ethers. Moreover, this catalytic reaction is the first reported reaction producing a high-yielding Anti-Markovnikov aromatic alkylation of an enol ether.",0.6990070939064026,0.699999988079071

Abstract (maximum 150 words):  An efficient method for the nitration of aromatic derivatives is necessary since nitroarenes have many applications in various areas. There are lots of metal-mediated methods which can be used for nitration but these use large quantities of metal which is expensive. There are also less methods to nitrate anilides and previously none of these involved using silver complexes which are much cheaper. Because of this, an investigation was performed to determine an effective method for nitrating anilines utilizing silver. After many different experiments, varying different parameters, the conclusion could be drawn that the most effective method for the nitration of anilides uses sodium nitrite in the presence of K2S2O8 (as the oxidant) in acetonitrile at 110¬∞C, with a silver based catalyst (10 mol-% of AgNO2 gave the best yield).

However, life is far from a system in equilibrium, and it is debated which factors drive replication towards the conditions observed in living organisms. Cyclic self-replicating peptides, a hexamer and heptamer, were investigated under differing mechanical agitations ‚Äì no agitation, stirring and shaking ‚Äì in the presence of the thermodynamic trimer and tetramer mixture. The hexamer and heptamer were shown to be formed of fibres in a b-sheet formation, which was crucial to self-replication and resulted in mechanosensitivity: the fibre structure prevented re-equilibration to other macrocyclic structures. Hexamer dominated under shaking whilst heptamer dominated under stirring due to differences in efficiency of fibre fragmentation, influencing exponential growth. The results demonstrated that mechanical forces can influence which replicators dominate, and this shift towards kinetic control was crucial to the evolution of life.",0.7554916739463806,0.800000011920929

How did life begin on Earth and how might that enable us to look for it elsewhere? We know that self-replicating molecules make up all living organisms, so it stands to reason that a synthetic method for producing these molecules could go a long way to helping answer this question. Methods for this have previously been described, but this paper provides evidence of how external factors, such as shaking and stirring can impact the rates two reactions involved in Œ≤-sheet formation to promote the formation of kinetically favoured products, allowing for pre-biotic life to transition away from thermal equilibrium towards systems that would be more familiar to us in our world today.",0.7663182020187378,0.6000000238418579

Catalytic C-H functionalizations using iron, especially involving aromatics, have been explored very little and there were still great limitations in the substrate scope of the catalysts used. This experiment was concerned with finding a simple catalyst system that allows mild, selective, and efficient C-H additions to aromatic ketones. Through reactions of aromatic ketones with different substituents and an array of different alkenes, using Fe(PMe3)4 as a catalyst, it is shown that there is excellent regioselectivity towards the anti-Markovnikov addition of ortho C-H bonds in aromatic ketones with high to excellent yields. Adding to this, the first ever high-yielding anti-Markovnikov addition of aromatic C-H bonds to enol ethers was developed.",0.6683553457260132,0.75

Abstract (maximum 150 words):   Sulfur compounds containing a tetrahydrothiophene ring system as a core structure have therapeutic applications, hence the demand for new tetrahydrothiophene derivatives is constantly growing at the biological, pharmacological, and medicinal chemistry level. The presence of a trifluoromethyl group is an example of this since it can cause changes in the physico-chemical properties of a molecule. However, not much could be found in the literature. For that reason, the aim of this study was to synthesize trifluoromethyl tetrahydrothiophene derivatives substituted with heteroatomic functional group. The approach for the synthesis consisted of using a [3+2]-cycloaddition reaction of a 1-functionalized 3,3,3-trifluoropropene derivative as dipolarophile with various 1,3 dipoles and thiocarbonyl ylide generated in situ from elimination of chloromethyl trimethylsilylmethyl sulfide.

It was found that the products of rice fermentation differed significantly between obligatory heterofermentative and facultatively heterofermentative/ obligatorily homofermentative LAB, particularly the amounts of ethanol, 3-hydroxybutan-2-one and butane-2,3-dione. This can be accounted for by different metabolic pathways. Principle component analysis showed that fermented rice samples can be categorised into different LAB strains.

This reaction is remarkable due to the large variety of alkenes that can be used, and the excellent regioselectivity toward the anti-Markovnikov products. Before this reaction was discovered, there was not a low-cost catalyst system, using abundant first row transition metals which could be carried out under mild reaction conditions. However, this reaction uses a relatively simple low-valence iron complex catalyst that is not formed in-situ like most iron catalysed C-H functionalizations. It can be used with or without a solvent at relatively low reaction temperatures, and the linear alkylation products produced have excellent yields.

Thus this paper describes the synthesis of 3-functional 4-trifluoromethyl-tetrahydrothiophenes, which is initiated by producing thiocarbonyl ylide from the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of electron-deficient alkenes; this occurs in situ by elimination of chloromethyl trimethylsilylmethyl sulphide (which is prepared from trimethylsilylmethanethiol, 1,3,5-trioxane and gaseous hydrochloric acid ) and the reaction proceeds under reflux in the presence of acetonitrile,  1.5-fold excess sulphide and 2-fold excess caesium fluoride.

The nitration was found to produce moderate to high yields for anilides, giving slightly better results for anilides substituted with electron-donating groups. The development of this method of ortho-nitration of anilides can prove to be valuable for the pharmaceutical and petroleum industries.",0.564009428024292,0.75

R2PNa then reacts with ArCl to afford R2PAr.  R2PNa produces higher yields and no coupled products unlike the use of R2PLi and R2PK; it is also more economic due to its abundance and safer to handle. ArCl is used in favour of ArBr and ArI due to generating higher yields. The reaction of ArCl and R2PNa was accelerated by the presence of an electron-withdrawing group on the benzene ring and decelerated by alkyl groups.

Abstract (maximum 150 words):   Through the use of 1,3-dipolar [3+2]-cycloaddition reactions with derivates of 3,3,3-trifluoropropene and thiocarbonyl ylide, advancements of 4-(trifluoromethyl)tetrahydrothiophenes consisting of a sulfoximine, sulfonamide, ester or phosphate moiety located at site 3 were able to be synthesised. Interest in the development of these advancements stems from the biological uses associated with the tetrahydrothiophene ring contained within heterocyclic moieties that accommodate sulfur. The heterocyclic compound can be significantly altered through the introduction of molecules containing sulfur, phosphorus or a trifluoromethyl group. This can further lead to the uncovering of future potential pharmaceuticals. This journal concludes that it is possible to synthesise these derivatives through 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition and that some of the products produced were among 4-(trifluoromethyl)tetrahydrothiophenyl-S-S-dioxides, S-imino-S-oxides and S,S-oxides.",0.6251237988471985,0.6000000238418579

Abstract: The preparation, application and reaction mechanism of sodium phosphide R2PNa have been studied and compared with other alkali metal phosphides R2PM (M = Li and K) with Na found superior to Li and K. R2PNa could be selectively and accurately prepared at room temperature via reaction of R2PZ (Z = Ar, Cl, OR etc.) with SD (sodium finely dispersed in paraffin oil) and also from triarylphosphines and diarylphosphines via the selective cleavage of C‚àíP bonds. R2PNa was reacted with a variety of ArCl to efficiently produce R2PAr in high yields. ArCl is superior to ArBr and ArI since they only gave low yields of the products. An electron-withdrawing group on the benzene ring of ArCl substantially accelerated the reactions withR2PNa. The application of this method was demonstrated by preparing a wide range of organophosphines from their corresponding chlorides, and chiral phosphines from sodium phosphides and methyl chlorides. Unsymmetrical phosphines could also be conveniently generated in one pot synthetic procedure from Ph3P. Possible echanisms were given for the reductive cleavage of R3P by sodium to R2PNa and the following reactions of R2PNa with ArCl generating R2PAr.",0.8674193620681763,0.0

(PSiP)-Ni was found to efficiently catalyze (E)-selective semihydrogenation of alkynes under very mild conditions with H2. Stoichiometric experiments showed the high selectivity of (PSiP)-Ni is due to the alkyne inserting into the complex and isomerization of the alkene being facile processes. This allowed a simple catalytic cycle to be proposed based off the results of the stoichiometric experiments and the reduced ability of (PSiP)-Ni to hydrogenate internal alkenes.",0.6921176910400391,0.75

This means that all-cis-multifuorinated cycloalkanes have substantial electrostatic character. They have dipole moments perpendicular to the aliphatic ring. The cis selectivity is favoured as hydrogenation of arenes is usually highly cis-selective and it‚Äôs obtained by nucleophilic substitution. The hydrogenation of stabilized arenes is dominated by heterogeneous catalysis. A method was obtained for the highly selective hydrogenation of (multi)fluorinated arenes and heteroarenes. To reduce multiple products on this reaction yield, a combination of rhodium with a strongly electron-donating cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) ligand can be used. In this route decomposition pathways were significantly diminished. The impact of this route is a single step method for multisubstitusted and multiflourinated cycloalkanes. This includes cis configured aliphatic hetrocycles and all cis 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexafluorocyclohexanes.",0.759605348110199,0.550000011920929

This procedure tolerates the use of varying electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups on N-protected indoles and iodoarenes.

This unequal equilibrium could be the consequence of a whole range of factors, some impacting the equilibrium more significantly than others. With the use of small dynamic combinatorial libraries an investigation was carried out on two self-replicating macrocycles derived from peptides, competing for raw materials. The replication is driven by formation of fibers, made up of macrocycle monomers and stabilized with ÔÅ¢-sheets, promoting further formation. Mechanosensitivity, whether the sample is stirred or shaken influences which macrocycle is the more dominant one.

Numerous synthetic routes based on the oxa-Pictet-Spengler reaction have been established to produce substituted isochromans. However, these require costly conditions to synthesise a low-yield whilst forming toxic side products. The aim is to determine a more cost-effective method to produce a high yield of isochromans without damaging the environment. Here we show that the iron catalyst, Fe(OTf)2, gives the highest yield of product at a low concentration of 1 mol% compared to more toxic Br√∏nsted and Lewis acids. Fe(OTf)2 produces isochromans and the side product of water, so is environmentally benign. The reaction involves a relatively low temperature of 70¬∫C and reaction period of 4 hours with the Fe(OTf)2 and toluene solvent to give a high yield of 99%. These economic conditions and environmentally-friendly reaction provides a more accessible way to produce isochromans for pharmaceutical compounds.",0.7986943125724792,0.8999999761581421

There has been a variety of similar experiments considering earth abundant metals with mild reaction conditions, however none received the excellent yields and regioselectivity that this simple catalyst produced. The alkylation reaction found that the coupling of alkenes with the ortho C-H bonds in aromatic ketones was selectively favoured to produce linear alkylation products. A broad variety of alkenes were discovered to be applicable for this mechanism: an enamine, vinylsilanes, styrenes and aliphatic terminal alkenes all produced high yields. Significantly, for the first time, the reaction of aromatic ketones with enol ethers afforded the highly yielding predominant formation of anti-Markovnikov addition products (up to 97%).",0.7178919911384583,0.75

Abstract (maximum 150 words):  A published method of synthesis asserts to have afforded the compound 4-tert-butyl-2,6-dinitrobenzaldehyde, but instead had synthesised the compound 4-tert-butyl-3,5-dinitrobenzaldehyde. This creates a problem as the 2,6-dinitro isomer is a lot more useful in chemistry and is used to prepare a number of dyes, pigments and other macromolecules. This incorrect method of synthesis has also been cited by articles, leading to another incorrect synthesis and misidentification of the compound tetrakis-5,10,15,20-(4‚Ä≤-tert-butyl-3‚Ä≤,5‚Ä≤- dinitrophenyl) porphyrin. This paper looks at some different methods of synthesising 4-tert-butyl-2,6-dinitrobenzaldehyde, balancing the contributing factors to its suitability, such as scalability for mass production, percentage yield and expense. It also suggests an adapted synthesis for 4-tert-butyl-3,5-dinitrobenzaldehyde, improving its method of synthesis by taking these factors into account. The single-crystal X-ray structures are also described, as this step was responsible for realising that the compound 4-tert-butyl-3,5-dinitrobenzaldehyde had been misidentified as 4-tert-butyl-2,6-dinitrobenzaldehyde.",0.6676552891731262,0.75

Abstract (maximum 150 words):     C-F bonds are considered the most polarized single carbon bonds in organic chemistry due to their electrostatic character. This property is used in both pharmaceutical and agrochemical science to for example tweak polarity. If the C-F bond‚Äôs orientations are further controlled to be on the same face they can be used to design high polar complexes, such as all-cis-multifluorinated cycloalkanes, that can be applied to other scientific areas like material sciences. However, all-cis-multifluorinated cycloalkanes are complex to synthesize as they need multistep sequences from diastereoselectively prefunctionalized precursors. This study therefore postulated a one-step rhodium-cyclic (alkyl) (amino) carbene (CAAC) ‚Äì catalysed hydrogenation pathway to be applied to fluorinated arenes in hexanes, to derive desired cis-fluorinated compounds. The one-step process allows the production of multiple multifluorinated and multisubstituted cycloalkanes such as cis-configured fluorinated aliphatic heterocycles and all-cis-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexafluorocyclohexane.",0.7324600219726562,0.75

Abstract (maximum 150 words):  A direct method has been reported for the first time for the stereoselective synthesis of multi-substituted cyclobutanes. Unlike previously used synthesis methods such as [2+2] cycloaddition, radical cyclisation, and ring contraction extrusion, this allows for the novel product of cyclobutanes with heterocyclic substituents. A possible mechanism has been proposed for this synthesis involving an initial reaction between the pyrrolidine and iodonitrene species to form a 1,1-diazene. Subsequent elimination of N2, mediated by nitrogen extrusion to generate a 1,4-biradical product which undergoes rapid cyclisation yielding the cyclobutene product is suggested. The viability of this method is proven through the formal synthesis of piperabronine B outlined in this paper. Beyond this, optimum temperature conditions are explored in optimizing the solubility of the starting material and intermediates. Despite these optimized conditions, yield varies from low to good, ranging from 24-42% for pyrrolidines with ‚ç∫-heteroarene substituents, and 42-88% for pyrrolidines with ‚ç∫-aryl substituents.    149 words",0.8083149790763855,0.6499999761581421

An alternative method of N-methylation of amines has been developed to mitigate these problems. Through use of a hydrogen borrowing strategy a more efficient way of N-methylation presents itself. The general reaction involves an oxidation of methanol with a metal, forming a ketone, and the hydrogen which has been removed is bound to the metal in a borrowing like manner; the hydrogen is given back to the new imine which is formed from reductive amination of the ketone. Compounds can be altered from being O-methylated to N-methylated through this strategy with minimal use of hazardous materials or problems with regioselectivity.",0.7999835014343262,0.6000000238418579

It is known that molecules can self-replicate by kinetically controlled autocatalysis; however, these systems are very simple compared to organisms with complex internal organization, so what factors move replication forward the most is under investigation. By using a small dynamic combinatorial library, two self-replicating peptide-derived macrocycles are reported. It is found that macrocycles are capable of promoting their own formation, while forming extended assemblies held together with ùõΩ-sheet type structures. Furthermore, the mode of agitation (shaking and stirring) influences which replicator dominates.

We focus particularly on the use of the PSiP-supported Ni hydride (iPr-PSiPInd)NiH complex in the formation of (E)-alkenes under 1 atm H2, 25-50ÔÇ∞C, and 1‚Äì2.5 mol % Ni. The use of this catalyst affords an atom-economical catalytic cycle that provides a high (E)-selectivity (E:Z 99:1) and tolerance of a diverse range of functional groups with no over-hydrogenation observed. This is achieved through the formation of alkenyl complex (iPr-PSiPInd)Ni(CPh=CHPh) and its reaction with H2 to afford the (Z)-alkene isomer, which subsequently readily undergoes ÔÅ¢-hydride elimination to generate the desired (E)-alkene.",0.6245994567871094,0.800000011920929

To force the C3 position, must current reactions use heavy metal catalysts or photocatalysts. This article demonstrates a more environmentally friendly way of creating this reaction using visible light with no catalysts necessary. Using aryl diazonium salts, and the creation of an EDA complex is a new reaction mechanism which will work to create the C3 arylated 2H indazoles.

Abstract (maximum 150 words): The electronic properties of cis-multifluorinated cycloalkanes, particularly the highly polarised and highly desired C-F bond, mean such compounds are sought after by the pharmaceutical, agrochemical, and material science industries. A synthetic route is discussed via the catalytic hydrogenation of fluoroarenes to the advantageous cis-(multi)fluorinated cycloalkanes. Herein, a highly selective pathway for the hydrogenation of a broad scope of (multi)fluorinated arenes and heteroarenes, hence offering access to cis-diastereoselectively (multi)fluorinated building blocks, highly polar all-cis-(multi)fluorocycloalkanes, and fluorinated aliphatic heterocycles is described. We used preliminary mechanistic experiments to investigate the observed increase in selectivity for the hydrogenated product versus the hydrofluorinated side product by changing the polarity of the solvent; for example, the selectivity using a polar solvent such as methanol (1:9) was compared to that of the less polar solvent dichloromethane (5:1). There was an overall suggestion that the observed defluorination in methanol and dichloromethane occurs through different mechanistic pathways.",0.7914912104606628,0.6499999761581421

To find the best system, a mathematical formula combining reaction efficiency and enantiocontrol in a high-throughput analysis was used.

Abstract (maximum 150 words): Common biological molecules such as DNA and RNA have the ability to self-replicate through kinetically controlled autocatalysis and in the case of some other molecules, cross-catalytic processes. This is due to the presence of precursor, ‚Äúbuilding block‚Äù, molecules that simultaneously catalyse and participate in the target bio-molecule‚Äôs formation. These ‚Äúbuilding blocks‚Äù can go many routes to form different molecules and so the products made are present in a mixture of non-specific equilibria. Although some products will be more present than others due to varying bond stability, there has to be some form of selectivity that can favour the desired reaction from a vast library of precursor reagents. Mechanosensitive reactions experience changes in equilibria when the system is exposed to different amounts of mechanical force/exerted kinetic energy and so can select the desired product based on force.",0.7376548051834106,0.6499999761581421

Abstract (maximum 150 words):   The method for the nitration of aromatic derivatives from organoprecursors for the synthesis of important chemical substances, such as pharmaceuticals, dyes and explosives that have high demand due to their versatility, have evolved due to the ineffectiveness of traditional methods which have the disadvantages of high cost, byproducts, harsh reaction conditions, low regioselective and limited functional group tolerance and unfavourable reaction conditions. The most efficient one to date is the general and regiospecific synthesis of substituted ortho-nitro anilines from the corresponding anilides and sulfonamides. The anilides with electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups substituted on the aromatic had high functional group tolerance along with a high yield. The highest yield was achieved with specific conditions AgNO2 catalyst which enabled regioselective ortho C-H bond nitration of the anilides, CH3CN organic solvent, K2S2O8 oxidant in acetonitrile through the method of C-H bond activation and at 110 ¬∞C and the presence of electron donating groups.",0.6685487031936646,0.699999988079071

Abstract (maximum 150 words):  Aryl iodide synthesis is commonly carried out by electrophilic iodination, Sandmeyer reaction, and multiple alternative methods. An improved method for iodo-decarboxylation of aryl carboxylic acids into aryl iodides with efficient catalysis has been detailed, using Cu(OAc)2 for a Cu-catalyzed intermediate in aerobic conditions with a halide source. In this case, an iodine source (NaI) provides an I- ion with the Cu-aryl intermediate to form a aryl-Cu(II)-I complex followed by the formation of the desired aryl-iodide product. A resulting side product, Cu(0) is readily oxidized to Cu(II), closing a catalytic cycle that only functions under aerobic conditions.  Aryl iodides hold great importance across industrial fields, a cheaper, less complex method is highly viable in comparison to the current conventional methods. Moderately good yields were observed with tolerance to electron sufficient and deficient groups.",0.6518951654434204,0.800000011920929

This synthesis is important as the benzoic acid and sodium iodide are stable, non-toxic, out with extreme doses, and cheap to buy. This method uses copper acetate as a catalyst for the substitution of the carboxylate with iodine. The copper starts and ends in a Cu(II) state when performed aerobically, this contrasts other methods which uses copper iodide sources and other metals as a catalyst making them more expensive reactions. The yield for the reaction is only 50% but is improved up to 81% through the use of other substituents such as the methoxy group when added in a para conformation to the carboxylate group.
