"The aim of the experiment was to prepare and isolate tin iodide by recrystallisation and then examine the resulting crystals by carrying out three separate chemical tests. Tin metal (1.0g) and iodine pellets (2.5g) were weighed separately and then added to one 100cm3 Quickfit conical flask. Toluene (10cm3) and 3 anti-bumping granules were then transferred to the conical flask. A reflux condenser was set up in which the water supply entered the bottom of the condenser and left at the top through rubber pipes. After the water supply had been turned on, heating commenced to 60% power of the heating mantle until the condensing solvent had gone from purple to colourless and the heating was turned off. The solution was left to cool and residual tin left in the reaction flask after the solution was decanted. Petroleum spirit (10cm3) was added to the solution. The dried tin metal was weighed and recorded. As the conical flask was left to cool, orange crystals were formed. They were then filtered, washed with cold petroleum spirit (10cm3) and weighed. A micro spatula tip of SnI4 and H2O (15-20mL) were reacted and shaken until all orange crystals weren�t visible. This solution was examined in the following three tests: Test 1: 0.1mol silver nitrate (4-5 drops) and the solution (1-2mL) were transferred to a test tube and shaken and observed. Test 2: The solution (1-2mL) was transferred to another test tube. Copper wire was heated until glowing red then immersed into the solution. The wire was heated again after it had been immersed and observed. Test 3: 3% H2O2 (10 drops) and the solution (1-2mL) were transferred to a third test tube and shaken for 30 seconds. Petrol (2-3mL) was then added and the resulting biphasic solution observed.

"The aim of the experiment was to react tin with iodine to produce SnI4 and preform reactivity tests on this compound. Tin (1.04g) and iodine (2.5g) were suspended in toluene (10 cm3) and reflux was carried out until the initially violet vapour turned clear and the solution was orange. The resulting liquid was decanted and was added to petroleum spirit 40/60 (10 cm3) and placed in an ice bath. The left-over tin metal was washed, dried and weighed. The crystals were washed with petroleum spirit 40/60 (10 cm3), dried and then weighed. A sample of the crystals was dissolved in water (15 cm3) and pH was recorded. Three tests were conducted with this solution. Test 1 was adding silver nitrate (0.1 M, 4 drops) to a sample of the solution (1-2 mL). Test 2 was a Beilstein test and test 3 was adding hydrogen peroxide (3%, 10 drops) and petroleum (2-3 mL) to the solution (1-2 mL) to form a biphasic solution.

"The aim of the experiment is to react tin metal with iodide, forming tin iodide that can then undergo different tests to observe it�s reactivity. 1g of tin is transferred into a round bottom conical flask along with 2.5g of iodine, 10cm^3 of toluene and 3 anti-bumping granules. The conical flask is placed on a heating mantle at 60% power and attached to a reflux condenser. The solution should turn from violet to orange to clear, before being cooled with 10cm^3 of petrol. The tin should then be washed with acetone, and the dried tin metal can be weighed. The flask can then be cooled in an ice bath, where orange crystals should form and can be weighed. A micro spatula of the resulting tin iodide crystals should then be dissolved in around 15 mL of water and the pH tested. The tests can now be carried out. In test 1, 4 drops of 0.1 M silver nitrate are added to 1 mL of the solution in a test tube to observe the result. Test 2 involves the Beilstein test, where a sterilized copper wire is heated with a Bunsen burner and dipped into 1 mL of solution in a test tube before placing the rod back into the flame to observe the flame colour. In test 3, 10 drops of 3% Hydrogen peroxide is added to 1 mL of solution in a test tube then adding 2 mL of petrol to observe the reaction.",0.7159632444381714,0.44999998807907104
"The aim of this experiment was to prepare a sample of tin iodide from iodine and tin and to investigate its properties by performing three different tests on it. Tin metal (0.98g), iodine pellets (2.51g), toluene (10mL) and some anti-bumping granules were added to a round-bottom flask equipped for heating under reflux. The mixture was heated until the solution was orange and the condensing solvent was clear. The solution was allowed to cool until the solvent stopped condensing. The solution was transferred into a conical flask, ensuring that the residual tin metal remained in the round-bottom flask. Petroleum spirit 40/60 (10mL) was transferred to the conical flask and the solution was allowed to cool to room temperature to allow crystals to form, then placed in an ice bath for 5 minutes. The residual tin was washed with acetone and allowed to dry, after which it was weighed. The crystals were filtered and washed with petroleum spirit 40/60 (10mL) and the dried crystals were weighed. A heaped micro spatula of SnI4 was mixed with water (20mL) and the pH was tested using pH paper. Silver nitrate (five drops) and this solution (2mL) were added to a test tube and the reaction was observed. A copper wire, first heated in a Bunsen flame until it was red, was immersed in 2mL of the solution, then held back in the Bunsen flame. The flame colour was noted. Hydrogen peroxide (ten drops) was added to 2mL of the solution and gently shaken. Petroleum spirit 40/60 (2mL) was added and the resulting reaction was observed.

"The aim was to prepare a tin iodide mixture from its constituent elements, and through condensing, the isolated crystals left, underwent tests to conclude how reactive the compound was. Tin (1.13g), iodine pellets (2.49g) and toluene (10cm3) were refluxed at approximately 170�C. The finished point of heating was identified when the condensed solvent dropping back into the round bottom flask became clear.  Once the solvent stopped condensing, whilst the solution was still hot, it was transferred (with the remaining solid tin left in the condensing flask) along with petroleum 40-60 (10cm3) into a conical flask, in an ice bath to quicken recrystallisation. Remaining tin was rinsed with acetone and left to dry (0.53g) whilst orange crystals began to form in conical flask.  These crystals were filtered, dried and weighed (1.97g). A generous microspatula tip of dried crystals were dissolved in water (20cm3) and shaken (pH of 1).  This solution was used for the following tests. Solution (2cm3) was transferred to test tube along with silver nitrate (0.1M, 5 drops).  Mixture was gently shaken for approximately 30 seconds. Solution (2cm3) was transferred to test tube.  A copper wire was heated until visibly glowing.  At this point, end of wire was dipped into test tube and then put back into flame. Solution (2cm3) was transferred to test tube along with hydrogen peroxide (3%, 10 drops).  Test tube was shaken for approximately 30 seconds before adding petroleum 40-60 (2-3cm3).

"The aim of this experiment was to become more acquainted at using the reflux condenser and be able the Buchner funnel. The aim was also to become better suited at weighing out accurate measurements, dealing with more dangerous substances. After using a weighing out about 1g of tin metal and transferring it into a round-bottomed flask using a plastic funnel, I added the appropriate amount of iodine (2.5g), again with the plastic funnel and set up the apparatus for reflux. Then after adding 10 cm� of toluene and a few anti-bumping granules, the heat was ready to be applied for reflux. After the reaction has finished, which will be visible by the solution going an orange colour and the vapours becoming colourless, I decanted the tin metal to a watch glass to weigh it. Once the solution has then cooled using an ice bath, it was then time to filter off the crystals using the Buchner funnel, washing them with 10cm� of petroleum spirit 40/60. Finally, after weighing my dried crystals I dissolved them in a small amount of water to prepare them for 3 tests. The first, during which I would add a small amount of silver nitrate, the second in which I would heat a copper wire and then after getting some of my solution on it, I would I test the flame colour and finally I would add small amounts of hydrogen peroxide and a similar amount of petrol to take note on the colours of the biphasic solution.

"The aim of this experiment was to prepare SnI4 from its elements, isolate it and investigate its reactivity by performing tests on it. 1.03g of tin metal, 2.56g of iodine pellets and 10cm3 of toluene were heated and reacted under reflux, with a few anti-bumping granules. When the solution changed from violet to orange, with the condensing solvent being clear the solution was allowed to cool until the solvent stopped condensing. The residual tin was then collected and weighed and petroleum spirit 40/60 was added to the product and allowed to cool to room temperature. The product was cooled in an ice bath to maximise crystallisation, that is the formation of orange crystals. The crystals were then filtered off and washed with 10cm3 of petroleum spirit 40/60 and the crystals weighed. To investigate the chemical properties of the product tests were carried out. SnI4 (product) was dissolved in 15-20 ml of water until the orange solid was no longer visible. At this point the pH was checked and three tests carried out. The first test was to add 4 or 5 drops of 0.1M silver nitrate to 1-2ml of the solution and gently shake for approximately 30 seconds. The second test was to carry out a Beilstein flame test to test for halide ions. The final test was to add 10 drops of 3% hydrogen peroxide to 1-2ml of the solution and shake the solution for approximately 30 seconds. 2-3ml of petrol was then added to the solution and gently swirled to form a biphasic solution.
