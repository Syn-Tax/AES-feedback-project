"In this experiment SnI4 crystals were synthesised and purified from Sn and I2. The crystals were dissolved in water and then tested using three tests: a) addition of silver nitrate b) Beilstein test c) addition of hydrogen peroxide and petrol. This enabled the reactivity of SnI4 to be investigate. Tin (1.0g), iodine (2.5g) and toluene (10cm3) were added to a reaction flask and reflux carried out until the condensed solvent had become colourless. The resulting solution was decanted leaving the tin residue in the reaction flask.  The tin residue was then washed using acetone and the dried tin residue weighed. Petroleum spirit 40/60 (10cm3) was added to the decanted solution and cooled using an ice bath allowing crystals to form. The crystals were then filtered under a vacuum and washed with petroleum spirit 40/60. The dried crystals of SnI4 were then weighed. A micro spatula of the SnI4 crystals were dissolved in water (15-20cm3). The dissolved solution of crystals (1-2mL) were add to silver nitrate 0.1M (4-5drops) and observations recorded.

"The aim of this experiment was to produce a tin iodide species derived from its elements whilst isolating it. The reactivity of the final product was also determined by carrying out 3 chemical tests.

A heaped microspatula tip of SnI4 was dissolved in water (15-20 ml) and the pH of the mixture was determined (pH 2). 3 tests were performed to determine the reactivity of the product which are as follows: Test 1: 4 drops of silver nitrate (0.1 M) was added to the solution (2 mL) and was gently shaken. Test2: 2 mL of the solution was used in the Beilstein�s test. The colour of the flame was observed.

The first test added 4 drops of silver nitrate to the SnI4 and water solution (2 cm3) which resulted in a color change from a colorless to yellow solution. The second test was a Beilstein flame test where a copper wire dipped in the SnI4 was subjected to a flame. The flame produced a green color. The third test added 10 drops of 3% hydrogen peroxide and petrol (2 cm3) to the SnI4 and water solution (2 cm3) which resulted in a biphasic solution of a yellow colored layer (on top) and brown colored layer (on the bottom). The experiment aimed to produce tin (IV) iodide (SnI4) and to test its reactive properties. Production of SnI4 The tin metal (1.0 g) and iodine (2.5 g) were suspended in toluene (10 cm3) and brought to reflux. The solution changed color from violet to orange which indicated reflux was complete. The orange solution was moved to an empty flask and put on ice to cool. There was residual tin metal (0.46 g) left in the original flask. Petroleum spirit 40/60 (10 cm3) was added to the flask containing the orange solution. The orange solution underwent recrystallization and was washed with additional petroleum spirit (10 cm3). The SnI4 product was orange colored crystalized solids (1.5 g).

"Aim The aim of the experiment was to prepare SnI4 from its elements and to test its reactivity. Procedure 1.0g of tin was transferred into a 100ml round bottom flask with the aid of a powder funnel to ensure none of the metal spilled on the bench. 2.5g of iodine pellets were also weighed and transferred to the flask. If the iodine pellets were spilled a member of staff was notified and the remains were disposed of in an aqueous solution of sodium metabisulphite. 10 cm3 of toluene was measured using a measuring cylinder and transferred into the round bottom flask along with 2 or three anti-bumping granules and a condenser was set up and turned on with the flask at the bottom and a heating mantle turned on to 60% power. The reaction was heated until the condensing liquid turned from violet to colourless. The flask was allowed to cool until the solvent stopped condensing. The solvent was decanted into a 100ml conical flask ensuring the residual tin was left in the flask. 10cm3 of petroleum 40/60 was added to the conical flask and allowed to cool to room temperature. The residual tin was then washed with acetone and weighed. The conical flask was placed in an ice bath and allowed to cool for 5 minutes to allow orange crystals to form. The crystals were then filtered using a Buchner funnel and washed with roughly 10cm3 petroleum 60/40 and weighed. A heaped microspatula of SnI4 was dissolved in roughly 15ml of water and the ph was tested using pH paper. The reactivity of SnI4 was tested using the following methods; Test 1: roughly 1 ml of SnI4 solution was transferred into a test tube and four drops of silver nitrate were added and shook gently for 30 seconds, the colour change was recorded. Test 2: roughly 1 ml of the solution was transferred into a different test tube and a copper wire was heated until it was glowing red. The wire was then immersed into the solution and the wire was then heated again, the colour of the flame was recorded.",0.5962987542152405,0.6299999952316284
"The aim of this experiment was to prepare SnI4 from its elements, isolate it and investigate its reactivity by performing tests on it. 1.03g of tin metal, 2.56g of iodine pellets and 10cm3 of toluene were heated and reacted under reflux, with a few anti-bumping granules. When the solution changed from violet to orange, with the condensing solvent being clear the solution was allowed to cool until the solvent stopped condensing. The residual tin was then collected and weighed and petroleum spirit 40/60 was added to the product and allowed to cool to room temperature. The product was cooled in an ice bath to maximise crystallisation, that is the formation of orange crystals. The crystals were then filtered off and washed with 10cm3 of petroleum spirit 40/60 and the crystals weighed. To investigate the chemical properties of the product tests were carried out. SnI4 (product) was dissolved in 15-20 ml of water until the orange solid was no longer visible. At this point the pH was checked and three tests carried out. The first test was to add 4 or 5 drops of 0.1M silver nitrate to 1-2ml of the solution and gently shake for approximately 30 seconds. The second test was to carry out a Beilstein flame test to test for halide ions. The final test was to add 10 drops of 3% hydrogen peroxide to 1-2ml of the solution and shake the solution for approximately 30 seconds. 2-3ml of petrol was then added to the solution and gently swirled to form a biphasic solution. The aim of this experiment was to prepare SnI4 from its elements, isolate it and investigate its reactivity by performing tests on it. 1.03g of tin metal, 2.56g of iodine pellets and 10cm3 of toluene were heated and reacted under reflux, with a few anti-bumping granules.

"The aim of the experiment was to produce and isolate a sample of tin iodide from its elements and then investigate its chemical properties through a series of chemical tests. 1.03g of tin metal was weighed out and 2.5g of Iodine pellets were then added. This was followed by the addition of 10cm3 of toluene and 3 anti-bumping granules. The solution was heated under reflux at approximately 150oC and heating was continued until the purple vapour rising from the solution (and condensing) had become clear. The solution was then allowed to cool until the solvent was all condensed. The hot solution was poured into a 100cm3 conical flask, leaving the residual tin in the flask. 10cm3 of petroleum spirit 40/60 was added to the conical flask and the solution was left to cool to room temperature. The residual tin was washed in the reaction flask with acetone and then left to dry on a watch glass. One dried it was weighed and the mass recorded. The cooled flask was placed in an icebath for approximately 5minutes. The crystals were then filtered out using a Buchner funnel and the dry crystals were weighed. For the chemical tests, a heaped micro spatula of the crystals (SnI4) were dissolved in 15ml of water. The pH of the resulting solution was tested using pH paper. 2mL of the solution was transferred into 3 test tubes. To the first, 4-5 drops of 0.1M silver nitrate were then added and the mixture gently shaken for 30s. Any changes in the solution were noted. For the second test tube, a copper wire was heated in a Bunsen flame and immersed in the solution before being heated again. The change in flame colour was recorded.",0.6840783953666687,0.7799999713897705
