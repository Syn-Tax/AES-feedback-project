My conclusion is that they did a pretty good job setting up the data table. They not only tried it once they tried it twice. One way they could of done a better job by instead of the data table they shouldn't did a bar graph.,0.015472839586436749,0.0

a) Plastic type B was the most stretchable plastic used because it was stretched longer than any other plastic in both trials. Plastic  type A had the least stretchability with 10mm for the first trial and 12mm for the second. ^p The student could have improved his/her experiment by keeping these two variables constant would make the experiment very reliable.,0.8616954684257507,0.6666666865348816
