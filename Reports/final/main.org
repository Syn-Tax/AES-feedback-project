* Introduction
An Automatic Essay Evaluation (AEE) system is a computational system that can assign an Essay, or other free-form written text, a grade and then provide textual and helpful feedback so that the student can improve their work. Advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have made purely neural approaches to this problem significantly more achievable.
