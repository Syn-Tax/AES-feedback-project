  abstract = {Automated Text Scoring (ATS) provides a cost-effective and consistent alternative to human marking. However, in order to achieve good performance, the predictive features of the system need to be manually engineered by human experts. We introduce a model that forms word representations by learning the extent to which specific words contribute to the text's score. Using Long-Short Term Memory networks to represent the meaning of texts, we demonstrate that a fully automated framework is able to achieve excellent results over similar approaches. In an attempt to make our results more interpretable, and inspired by recent advances in visualizing neural networks, we introduce a novel method for identifying the regions of the text that the model has found more discriminative.},

We follow past work in automated grading by first training a similarity metric between student responses, but then go on to use this metric to group responses into clusters and subclusters. The resulting groupings allow teachers to grade multiple responses with a single action, provide rich feedback to groups of similar answers, and discover modalities of misunderstanding among students; we refer to this amplification of grader effort as ``powergrading.'' We develop the means to further reduce teacher effort by automatically performing actions when an answer key is available. We show results in terms of grading progress with a small ``budget'' of human actions, both from our method and an LDA-based approach, on a test corpus of 10 questions answered by 698 respondents.},

  abstract = {Transformer-based models are unable to process long sequences due to their self-attention operation, which scales quadratically with the sequence length. To address this limitation, we introduce the Longformer with an attention mechanism that scales linearly with sequence length, making it easy to process documents of thousands of tokens or longer. Longformer's attention mechanism is a drop-in replacement for the standard self-attention and combines a local windowed attention with a task motivated global attention. Following prior work on long-sequence transformers, we evaluate Longformer on character-level language modeling and achieve state-of-the-art results on text8 and enwik8. In contrast to most prior work, we also pretrain Longformer and finetune it on a variety of downstream tasks. Our pretrained Longformer consistently outperforms RoBERTa on long document tasks and sets new state-of-the-art results on WikiHop and TriviaQA. We finally introduce the Longformer-Encoder-Decoder (LED), a Longformer variant for supporting long document generative sequence-to-sequence tasks, and demonstrate its effectiveness on the arXiv summarization dataset.},

For this purpose, we pose the following research question: How difficult is it to fool automatic short answer grading systems? In particular, we investigate the robustness of the state of the art automatic short answer grading system proposed by Sung et al. towards cheating in the form of universal adversarial trigger employment. These are short token sequences that can be prepended to students' answers in an exam to artificially improve their automatically assigned grade. Such triggers are especially critical as they can easily be used by anyone once they are found. In our experiments, we discovered triggers which allow students to pass exams with passing thresholds of \textbackslash textbackslash documentclass[12pt]\{minimal\} \textbackslash textbackslash usepackage\{amsmath\} \textbackslash textbackslash usepackage\{wasysym\} \textbackslash textbackslash usepackage\{amsfonts\} \textbackslash textbackslash usepackage\{amssymb\} \textbackslash textbackslash usepackage\{amsbsy\} \textbackslash textbackslash usepackage\{mathrsfs\} \textbackslash textbackslash usepackage\{upgreek\} \textbackslash textbackslash setlength\{\textbackslash textbackslash oddsidemargin\}\{-69pt\} \textbackslash textbackslash begin\{document\}\$\$50\textbackslash textbackslash\%\$\$\textbackslash textbackslash end\{document\}50\% without answering a single question correctly. Furthermore, we show that such triggers generalize across models and datasets in this scenario, nullifying the defense strategy of keeping grading models or data secret.},

It is particularly true for English as Second Language (ESL) students in China. It would be very useful if students could receive timely and effective feedback about their writing. Automatic essay feedback generation is a challenging task, which requires understanding the relationship between the text features of the essay and feedback. In this study, we first analyzed 1,290 teacher comments on their 327 Englishmajor students and annotated the feedback on seven aspects of writing, including the grammar, spelling, sentence diversity, structure, organization, supporting ideas, coherence, and conclusion, for each paper. Then, an automatic feedback classification experiment was conducted with the machine learning approach. Finally, we investigated the impact of the system generated-indirect corrective feedback (ICF) and human teachers' direct corrective feedback (DCF) in two English writing classes (N = 56 in ICF class; N = 54 in DCF class) at a key Chinese university through a web-based assignment management system. The study results indicated the feasibility of this approach that system generated ICF can be as useful as direct comments made by the teachers in terms of improving the quality of the content regarding to the structure, organization, supporting ideas, coherence, and conclusion, and encouraging students to spend more time on self-correction.},

Educational applications based on NLP and speech processing technologies often combine multiple complex machine learning algorithms and are thus vulnerable to the same sources of bias as other machine learning systems. Yet such systems can have high impact on people's lives especially when deployed as part of highstakes tests. In this paper we discuss different definitions of fairness and possible ways to apply them to educational applications. We then use simulated and real data to consider how test-takers' native language backgrounds can affect their automated scores on an English language proficiency assessment. We illustrate that total fairness may not be achievable and that different definitions of fairness may require different solutions.},

While many machine-learning approaches for AES still rely on a bag of words (BOW) approach, we consider a transformer-based approach in this paper, compare its performance to a logistic regression model based on the BOW approach, and discuss their differences. The analysis is based on 2088 email responses to a problem-solving task that were manually labeled in terms of politeness. Both transformer models considered in the analysis outperformed without any hyperparameter tuning of the regression-based model. We argue that, for AES tasks such as politeness classification, the transformer-based approach has significant advantages, while a BOW approach suffers from not taking word order into account and reducing the words to their stem. Further, we show how such models can help increase the accuracy of human raters, and we provide a detailed instruction on how to implement transformer-based models for one's own purposes.},

  abstract = {Automatic grading of handwritten essays is vital in evaluating the performance of students in educational settings, particularly in situations where language experts are rare. We build a system capable of taking the input as handwritten essays in image format and outputs the grading on the scale of 0-5; 0 being the worst and 5 being the best. The overall system integrates Optical Handwriting Recognition (OHR) and Automated Essay Scoring (AES)/grading. The handwritten essay is transcribed using a network composed of Multi-Dimensional Long Short Term Memory (MDLSTM) and convolution layers. The loss function is Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC). The AES model is a 2-layer artificial neural network with a feature set based on pretrained GloVe word vectors. The results of grading of essays are compared for transcriptions of essays received from OHR system and transcriptions of essays done manually. The mutual agreement between the two shows a Quadratic Weighted Kappa score of 0.88. The results indicate that though the current OHR systems have transcription errors but as a whole can perform well for an application like AES.},

The objective of the journal is to specially reduce the manpower and time consumption. Since in manual answer evaluation, the manpower and the time consumption is much more. Also, in the manual system, it may be possible that the marks given to two same answers are different. This application system provides an automatic evaluation of answer based on the keyword provided to the application in form of the input by the moderator which will provide equal distribution of marks and will reduce time and manpower.},

We explore several neural network models for the task of automated essay scoring and perform some analysis to get some insights of the models. The results show that our best system, which is based on long short-term memory networks, outperforms a strong baseline by 5.6\% in terms of quadratic weighted Kappa, without requiring any feature engineering.},

In this paper, we proposed and implemented a semantic-based feedback recommendation approach for automatic essay evaluation, which will allow assessors to interact with automatic essay evaluation systems, give feedback on learner's essay solution in the form of textual comments and provide recommendation to other similar essay solution based on the solution which the assessor has given textual feedback. To compute the semantic similarity and to provide feedback recommendation, we used neural word embedding and relaxed word mover's similarity. The proposed approach achieves high-performance accuracy, compared to the state-of-the-art methods, according to our experimental results.},

  abstract = {Recent developments in natural language representations have been accompanied by large and expensive models that leverage vast amounts of general-domain text through self-supervised pre-training. Due to the cost of applying such models to down-stream tasks, several model compression techniques on pre-trained language representations have been proposed (Sun et al., 2019; Sanh, 2019). However, surprisingly, the simple baseline of just pre-training and fine-tuning compact models has been overlooked. In this paper, we first show that pre-training remains important in the context of smaller architectures, and fine-tuning pre-trained compact models can be competitive to more elaborate methods proposed in concurrent work. Starting with pre-trained compact models, we then explore transferring task knowledge from large fine-tuned models through standard knowledge distillation. The resulting simple, yet effective and general algorithm, Pre-trained Distillation, brings further improvements. Through extensive experiments, we more generally explore the interaction between pre-training and distillation under two variables that have been under-studied: model size and properties of unlabeled task data. One surprising observation is that they have a compound effect even when sequentially applied on the same data. To accelerate future research, we will make our 24 pre-trained miniature BERT models publicly available.},

Although traditional AES models typically rely on manually designed features, deep neural network (DNN)-based AES models that obviate the need for feature engineering have recently attracted increased attention. Various DNN-AES models with different characteristics have been proposed over the past few years. To our knowledge, however, no study has provided a comprehensive review of DNN-AES models while introducing each model in detail. Therefore, this review presents a comprehensive survey of DNNAES models, describing the main idea and detailed architecture of each model. We classify the AES task into four types and introduce existing DNN-AES models according to this classification.},

Conventional AES methods typically rely on manually tuned features, which are laborious to effectively develop. To obviate the need for feature engineering, many deep neural network (DNN)-based AES models have been proposed and have achieved state-of-the-art accuracy. DNN-AES models require training on a large dataset of graded essays. However, assigned grades in such datasets are known to be strongly biased due to effects of rater bias when grading is conducted by assigning a few raters in a rater set to each essay. Performance of DNN models rapidly drops when such biased data are used for model training. In the fields of educational and psychological measurement, item response theory (IRT) models that can estimate essay scores while considering effects of rater characteristics have recently been proposed. This study therefore proposes a new DNN-AES framework that integrates IRT models to deal with rater bias within training data. To our knowledge, this is a first attempt at addressing rating bias effects in training data, which is a crucial but overlooked problem.},

We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.},

We applied our application to a set of manually graded essays provided by a previous competition on Kaggle in 2012 on automated essay grading and conducted a qualitative evaluation of the approach. The result shows that the program is able to correctly score most of the essay and give an evaluation close to that of a human grader on the rest.
